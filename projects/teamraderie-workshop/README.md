# Measure Twice, Spend Once - Workshop Materials

**Live Website:** https://measuretwicespendonce.com (CANONICAL VERSION)

## Project Status

The workshop materials have evolved from markdown documents to a professional website hosted on Replit. The website is now the **primary source of truth** for all workshop content.

## What's Where

- Process Selection Rubric (interactive)
- Synthesis Questions
- All formatted for participant use

**Local Website Files:**
- `measure-twice-spend-once-site/measuretwicespendonce-website-complete/` - Full site backup
- `REPLIT_AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` - Instructions for updating the site

**Workshop Delivery:**

## How to Update Workshop Materials

**For content changes:**
1. Update the Replit project (access via measuretwicespendonce.com Replit console)
2. Use `REPLIT_AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` as template for complex changes
3. Changes go live immediately

**For major revisions:**
1. Update Replit site
2. Export updated site to `measure-twice-spend-once-site/` directory
3. Update this README if structure changes

## Development History

1. **Oct 2025:** Initial markdown materials created with Claude Code
2. **Nov 1, 2025:** Website built on Replit, deployed to measuretwicespendonce.com
3. **Nov 13, 2025:** Added consistency improvements (setup protocol, verification, troubleshooting)

## Key Insight

The website proved superior to markdown files because:
- Copy-to-clipboard reduces user error
- Professional presentation increases credibility
- Navigation structure matches workshop flow
- Interactive elements (rubric) provide immediate value
- Single URL easier to share than multiple docs

**Decision:** Website is canonical. Markdown files retained for reference/archival purposes only.
