# ResearchKit Quals - Quick Start

**What is this?** A draft framework for the research competencies we think PhD students need to develop. We're using it to make tacit skills explicit and discussable.

**Why?** So we can talk concretely about what "good research instincts" are, how they develop, and how we'd know when a student has them.

## The 7 Domains (30-second version)

| # | Domain | Core Question | You Pass When... |
|---|--------|---------------|------------------|
| 1 | Pattern Recognition | Can you see what's worth pursuing? | You identify the same patterns experts do |
| 2 | Theoretical Positioning | Do you know what makes a contribution? | You can frame a finding theoretically |
| 3 | Qual Mechanism Extraction | Can you code data systematically? | Your coding overlaps with expert coding |
| 4 | Theoretical Framing | Can you generate and evaluate framings? | You produce framings that pass Zuckerman |
| 5 | Epistemological Genre | Do you know discovery vs testing? | You write in the appropriate genre |
| 6 | Adversarial Evidence | Can you find disconfirming evidence? | You find what experts find |
| 7 | Claim Verification | Do your claims match your evidence? | You catch the overclaims |

## Time Estimates

**Typical PhD student**: 3-6 months
**With prior qual training**: 6-10 weeks (test out of 1-3)

## Commands

```bash
/quals-status          # See your progress
/quals-take D1 L1      # Take Domain 1, Level 1 assessment
/quals-submit D3 L3    # Submit Domain 3, Level 3 work
```

## The Deal

The sequencing is suggested, not enforced — but we think these skills generally build on each other. Your advisor can accelerate you (with documentation) based on prior training.

The domain list itself is a draft. If you think something's missing, mislabeled, or shouldn't be here — that's exactly the kind of feedback we want.
