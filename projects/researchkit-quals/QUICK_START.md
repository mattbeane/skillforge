# ResearchKit Quals - Quick Start

**What is this?** A competency gate for TheoryForge. You prove you understand research methodology before using the power tool.

**Why?** So you don't produce polished papers without developing real skill.

## The 7 Domains (30-second version)

| # | Domain | Core Question | You Pass When... |
|---|--------|---------------|------------------|
| 1 | Pattern Recognition | Can you see what's worth pursuing? | You identify the same patterns experts do |
| 2 | Theoretical Positioning | Do you know what makes a contribution? | You can frame a finding theoretically |
| 3 | Qual Mechanism Extraction | Can you code data systematically? | Your coding overlaps with expert coding |
| 4 | Theoretical Framing | Can you generate and evaluate framings? | You produce framings that pass Zuckerman |
| 5 | Epistemological Genre | Do you know discovery vs testing? | You write in the appropriate genre |
| 6 | Adversarial Evidence | Can you find disconfirming evidence? | You find what experts find |
| 7 | Claim Verification | Do your claims match your evidence? | You catch the overclaims |

## The Deal

You can't skip domains. You can't skip levels. Your advisor can accelerate you (with documentation) but can't exempt you.

When you pass Domain 7, you have full TheoryForge access.

Until then, you're learning. That's the point.
