## Abstract

Artificial intelligence tools are rapidly transforming professional knowledge work, yet we know little about how consultants adapt their practices when these tools are introduced. Drawing on organizational learning theory and the literature on expertise development, we hypothesize that AI tool adoption will reshape consultants' knowledge work practices in three ways: by altering the structure of client interactions (H1), by shifting the locus of analytical expertise from individuals to human-AI assemblages (H2), and by creating new forms of status differentiation based on AI fluency (H3). We test these hypotheses using ethnographic data from 14 months of fieldwork across three management consulting firms. Our results confirm all three predictions, with notable variation across firm type. We contribute to research on technology and expertise by demonstrating that AI tools do not simply augment existing practices but fundamentally restructure them in ways predicted by organizational learning theory.

## Introduction

Management consulting has long served as a canonical example of knowledge-intensive work. Consultants are hired for their expertise: the ability to diagnose complex organizational problems, synthesize diverse information, and generate actionable recommendations (Empson, 2001; Werr & Stjernberg, 2003). This expertise is built through years of apprenticeship-like engagement with senior colleagues, client exposure, and iterative problem-solving.

The rapid adoption of AI-assisted tools in consulting threatens to reshape these practices in fundamental ways. Tools ranging from large language models to automated data analysis platforms are changing how consultants search for information, draft deliverables, and interact with clients. Yet we have limited empirical understanding of how these changes unfold in practice.

This paper addresses this gap by examining how AI-assisted tools change knowledge work in three consulting firms. Based on organizational learning theory (Argote & Miron-Spektor, 2011), we develop three hypotheses about the mechanisms through which AI adoption reshapes consulting practice. We then test these hypotheses using 14 months of ethnographic fieldwork, including over 200 hours of observation and 47 semi-structured interviews across three firms that vary in size, specialization, and AI adoption maturity.

Our findings offer three contributions. First, we demonstrate that AI tools reconfigure client interactions by shifting consultant preparation practices from deep, unstructured exploration to targeted, AI-mediated inquiry. Second, we show that analytical expertise migrates from individual consultants to what we term "human-AI assemblages" --- stable configurations of human judgment and algorithmic processing that become the functional unit of knowledge production. Third, we reveal that AI fluency creates a new axis of status differentiation that crosscuts traditional experience-based hierarchies.

## Theoretical Background and Hypothesis Development

### Knowledge Work and Expertise in Professional Services

Professional service firms depend on the expertise of their workers (Empson, 2001; von Nordenflycht, 2010). In consulting, this expertise takes multiple forms: analytical skill, client management capacity, domain knowledge, and the ability to synthesize complex information under time pressure (Werr & Stjernberg, 2003). Expertise develops through prolonged engagement with varied problems --- a process that organizational learning theory characterizes as experience-driven knowledge accumulation (Argote & Miron-Spektor, 2011).

A growing body of research has examined how technology mediates expertise. Studies of enterprise systems (Orlikowski, 2000), collaboration platforms (Leonardi, 2011), and automation (Autor, 2015) show that technology reshapes what workers need to know and how they deploy that knowledge. However, most existing research examines technologies that automate routine tasks, leaving the question of how AI tools --- which can engage with non-routine, judgment-intensive work --- reshape expertise largely unaddressed.

### AI Tools and Client Interaction Practices

Consulting work is fundamentally relational (Sturdy, 1997). Consultants derive authority from their perceived expertise, and client interactions are the primary venue where expertise is demonstrated and legitimacy is established. When AI tools alter the informational foundations of consulting work --- by enabling faster synthesis, broader search, or more sophisticated analysis --- they should also alter the relational dynamics through which expertise is displayed.

Based on organizational learning theory, we predict that AI adoption will restructure client interaction practices. Specifically, as consultants gain access to AI-powered synthesis tools, they will shift from open-ended "discovery" conversations with clients to more targeted, hypothesis-driven interactions. This shift should occur because AI tools allow consultants to arrive at client meetings with pre-formed analytical frameworks, reducing the need for exploratory dialogue.

**H1**: AI tool adoption will lead consultants to shift from exploratory to hypothesis-driven client interactions, as AI-mediated preparation reduces the need for open-ended discovery.

### AI Tools and the Locus of Expertise

Organizational learning theory posits that knowledge resides in individuals, tools, and routines (Argote & Miron-Spektor, 2011). When AI tools become integral to analytical work, the functional locus of expertise should shift from individual consultants to integrated human-AI configurations. This prediction follows from the observation that AI tools can store, retrieve, and process knowledge in ways that exceed individual cognitive capacity, while still requiring human judgment for contextual interpretation and client-facing communication.

We predict that this shift will manifest as a redistribution of analytical tasks: AI tools will increasingly perform the "heavy lifting" of data synthesis and pattern recognition, while consultants will focus on contextual interpretation, narrative construction, and client relationship management.

**H2**: AI tool adoption will shift the locus of analytical expertise from individual consultants to human-AI assemblages, as AI systems absorb analytical functions previously performed by individuals.

### AI Fluency and Status Differentiation

Status hierarchies in consulting are traditionally structured by experience and client relationships (Alvesson & Karreman, 2007). We expected that AI adoption would create a new dimension of status differentiation based on AI fluency --- the ability to effectively leverage AI tools for knowledge work tasks. Based on status characteristics theory (Berger et al., 1977), which predicts that competencies become status markers when they are perceived as relevant to group tasks, we hypothesize:

**H3**: AI tool adoption will create a new axis of status differentiation, where AI fluency becomes a status-conferring characteristic that crosscuts traditional experience-based hierarchies.

## Methods

### Research Design

I conducted ethnographic fieldwork across three management consulting firms from January 2023 through February 2024. The firms were selected to provide variation in size, specialization, and stage of AI tool adoption:

- **AlphaConsult** (pseudonym): Large global firm (~8,000 consultants), strategy-focused, early AI adopter with firm-wide rollout of proprietary tools
- **MidPoint Advisory** (pseudonym): Mid-size regional firm (~400 consultants), operations-focused, selective AI adoption in specific practice areas
- **Niche Partners** (pseudonym): Boutique firm (~45 consultants), specialized in financial services, experimenting with commercially available AI tools

### Data Collection

I collected three primary types of data:

1. **Participant observation** (208 hours): I observed consultants working on client projects, attending team meetings, using AI tools, and engaging in informal discussions. At AlphaConsult and MidPoint, I was granted office access and embedded with project teams. At Niche Partners, my access was more limited to scheduled observations.

2. **Semi-structured interviews** (47 total): I interviewed consultants at all levels --- junior analysts (n=16), senior consultants (n=14), managers (n=9), and partners (n=8). Interviews lasted 45-90 minutes and covered: daily work practices, AI tool use, perceived changes in expertise, client interactions, and career development concerns.

3. **Archival materials**: Internal presentations about AI tool deployment, training materials, Slack/Teams conversations about AI use (shared with consent), and deliverable drafts showing AI tool integration.

### Data Analysis

I analyzed the data using an iterative approach informed by grounded theory principles (Strauss & Corbin, 1998). I began with open coding of field notes and interview transcripts, identifying first-order categories that reflected informants' own language and concerns. I then grouped these into second-order themes through axial coding, and finally developed aggregate theoretical dimensions.

To test the robustness of the predicted patterns, I compared findings across the three firms, looking for consistent support as well as contradictions. I also actively sought disconfirming evidence within each site to challenge my initial interpretations.

## Results

### H1: Shift from Exploratory to Hypothesis-Driven Client Interactions

Consistent with our prediction, we found that AI tool adoption led consultants to shift from open-ended, exploratory client interactions to more targeted, hypothesis-driven conversations. This pattern was most pronounced at AlphaConsult, where AI tools were most deeply embedded in pre-meeting preparation routines.

Before AI tools became common, junior consultants described their preparation for client meetings as open-ended:

> "We used to spend hours just reading through everything --- annual reports, industry analyses, competitor profiles --- without a specific angle. You'd go into the meeting and just listen, trying to pick up on what mattered." (Junior Analyst, AlphaConsult)

After AI tool adoption, preparation shifted markedly. Consultants used AI tools to generate preliminary analyses and arrive at meetings with specific hypotheses to probe:

> "Now I'll spend maybe 30 minutes with [the AI tool], feed it the background materials, and ask it to generate the top five strategic issues. I go into the meeting with a framework already in mind. I'm testing whether my analysis holds, not discovering what the issues are." (Senior Consultant, AlphaConsult)

As hypothesized, this shift had consequences for the client relationship. Several partners expressed concern that junior consultants were losing the ability to engage in genuinely exploratory dialogue:

> "They come in with their AI-generated playbook and they're confirming, not exploring. I worry we're losing the capacity for surprise --- for that moment where the client says something unexpected and you think, 'Oh, I hadn't considered that.'" (Partner, AlphaConsult)

Support for H1 was found across all three firms, though the magnitude varied. At MidPoint, the shift was less dramatic because AI tools were used selectively, and at Niche Partners, the small team size meant that senior consultants could model exploratory behavior directly.

### H2: Migration of Expertise to Human-AI Assemblages

Results confirm the predicted migration of analytical expertise from individual consultants to human-AI assemblages. Across all three firms, I observed a consistent pattern: tasks that previously required substantial individual analytical skill were increasingly performed through integrated human-AI workflows.

A striking example emerged at MidPoint Advisory, where an operations consulting team used AI tools to analyze client supply chain data:

> "Two years ago, that analysis would have taken me a week. I'd be in Excel, building models, testing scenarios. Now I upload the data, describe what I'm looking for, and the tool gives me a first pass in 20 minutes. My job is to look at what it produces and decide what makes sense for this specific client." (Manager, MidPoint Advisory)

The concept of "human-AI assemblage" emerged from informants' own descriptions of their work. Consultants consistently described their analytical process not as "using a tool" but as a collaborative cognitive practice:

> "It's not like using a calculator. It's more like having a very fast, very literal-minded junior analyst. I think WITH it, not just through it." (Senior Consultant, Niche Partners)

We tested whether this assemblage pattern held for more complex, judgment-intensive tasks. It did, but with important boundary conditions. For tasks requiring deep client context or political sensitivity, consultants reverted to individual judgment:

> "The AI is brilliant at pattern-matching in data. But when I need to understand why the CFO keeps blocking our recommendations, that's all human. That's reading the room, understanding power dynamics. No AI for that yet." (Partner, MidPoint Advisory)

### H3: AI Fluency as Status Differentiator

As hypothesized, AI fluency emerged as a new axis of status differentiation across all three firms. This finding was most dramatic at AlphaConsult, where formal AI training programs created visible competency gradations, but was also present in subtler forms at the smaller firms.

At AlphaConsult, AI fluency disrupted the traditional experience-based hierarchy in observable ways:

> "There's this second-year analyst who's basically the AI whisperer. Partners come to HER to ask how to use the tools. That never would have happened with any other skill --- a second-year teaching a partner? But with AI, the juniors sometimes know more." (Manager, AlphaConsult)

The status implications varied by firm context, but the pattern was consistent. AI-fluent consultants --- regardless of tenure --- received greater visibility, were assigned to high-profile projects, and were consulted by more senior colleagues. This finding supports H3 and is consistent with status characteristics theory's prediction that task-relevant competencies generate status regardless of other characteristics.

However, the status conferral was not unlimited. At all three firms, client relationship skills remained the dominant status criterion at the partner level. AI fluency conferred status primarily among analysts and senior consultants --- the ranks where analytical work was most central:

> "At the end of the day, partners win work. And clients don't hire us for our AI. They hire us because they trust Marcus to understand their business. So yes, the AI kids get attention, but Marcus is still Marcus." (Manager, AlphaConsult)

## Discussion

### Summary of Findings

Our results provide support for all three hypotheses. As predicted by organizational learning theory, AI tool adoption restructured consulting work in systematic ways: client interactions shifted from exploratory to hypothesis-driven (H1), analytical expertise migrated from individuals to human-AI assemblages (H2), and AI fluency created a new dimension of status differentiation (H3).

These findings extend existing research on technology and expertise by showing that AI tools do not simply automate tasks --- they fundamentally reconfigure the social and cognitive organization of knowledge work. The concept of "human-AI assemblage" contributes a new theoretical construct for understanding how expertise operates when AI tools become integral to analytical practice.

### Theoretical Contributions

First, we contribute to organizational learning theory by demonstrating a novel form of knowledge storage. Argote and Miron-Spektor (2011) identify individuals, routines, and tools as repositories of organizational knowledge. Our findings suggest a fourth category --- human-AI assemblages --- that is irreducible to any single repository. The assemblage is more than the sum of human knowledge and tool capability; it produces analytical outcomes that neither could achieve independently.

Second, we contribute to research on status and expertise in professional services. While prior work has examined how formal credentials (Alvesson & Karreman, 2007) and client relationships (Sturdy, 1997) confer status, we identify AI fluency as a new status-conferring characteristic that operates through different mechanisms. Unlike experience, which accumulates slowly, AI fluency can be developed rapidly, creating the possibility of status disruption.

Third, we contribute to the emerging literature on AI and work by providing processual, in-context evidence of how AI adoption unfolds in practice. Most existing research relies on surveys or experimental studies that capture snapshots; our ethnographic approach reveals the unfolding dynamics through which AI tools become embedded in professional practice.

### Boundary Conditions

Our findings are bounded in important ways. First, consulting is an extreme case of knowledge-intensive work; the patterns we observe may be less pronounced in professional services where analytical work is a smaller component of daily practice. Second, our three-firm design limits statistical generalizability. Third, our 14-month observation window captures the early phases of AI adoption; longer-term dynamics may differ.

### Future Directions

Future research should examine whether the variables and relationships we identified hold in other knowledge-intensive contexts --- law, medicine, financial analysis --- where AI tools are also being adopted rapidly. Longitudinal studies tracking the same firms over multiple years would help distinguish transient adjustment dynamics from durable structural changes.
