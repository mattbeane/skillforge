## Abstract

Electronic health record (EHR) systems have become ubiquitous in modern healthcare, yet we lack understanding of how experienced nurses -- the backbone of patient care -- adapt their deeply ingrained workflow practices when these systems are imposed. Drawing on 32 semi-structured interviews and six months of ethnographic observation across four hospitals, this study identifies three mechanisms through which experienced nurses reconfigure their work: temporal restructuring of care routines, the development of "bridge practices" that hybridize analog and digital workflows, and the creation of informal knowledge networks for system navigation. Our findings provide strong evidence that EHR implementation fundamentally transforms nursing practice and offer a process model explaining how experienced practitioners adapt to mandated technological change. We contribute to research on technology and professional work by demonstrating that adaptation is not merely reactive compliance but an active, skilled reconfiguration of practice rooted in clinical expertise.

## Introduction

The adoption of electronic health records represents one of the most significant transformations in healthcare delivery of the past two decades. Mandated by policy (the HITECH Act of 2009) and promoted as a means to improve care quality, reduce errors, and enable data-driven decision-making, EHR systems have been implemented in the vast majority of U.S. hospitals (Adler-Milstein et al., 2017). Yet the experience of implementation on the ground -- particularly for experienced nurses who must fundamentally alter established practices -- remains poorly understood.

Existing research on EHR adoption has focused primarily on physician experiences (Friedberg et al., 2014), organizational-level implementation outcomes (Buntin et al., 2011), and usability issues (Carayon et al., 2015). The nursing perspective has been comparatively neglected, despite nurses spending more time in direct EHR interaction than any other clinical role. This gap matters because experienced nurses possess deep tacit knowledge about clinical workflows -- knowledge that is threatened, transformed, and in some cases lost when new documentation systems are introduced.

This paper addresses this gap through a qualitative study of experienced nurses (minimum 8 years tenure) across four hospitals at different stages of EHR implementation. I conducted 32 semi-structured interviews and approximately 480 hours of ethnographic observation over six months. The hospitals varied in size, patient population, and EHR vendor, providing a natural comparison of implementation contexts.

My analysis reveals three interconnected processes through which experienced nurses adapt: (1) temporal restructuring, in which nurses fundamentally reorganize the timing and sequencing of care activities around documentation demands; (2) bridge practices, in which nurses develop hybrid analog-digital workflows that preserve clinical judgment while satisfying system requirements; and (3) informal knowledge networks, in which nurses create peer-to-peer learning structures to share system navigation strategies outside of official training channels.

These findings contribute to the literature on technology and professional work by showing that experienced practitioners do not simply comply with or resist new systems. Instead, they engage in skilled, creative adaptation that draws on the very expertise the new system threatens to marginalize. This process model of adaptation challenges the dominant compliance/resistance framework and reveals how clinical expertise shapes technological adoption from the bottom up.

## Theoretical Background

### Technology and Professional Work

The relationship between technology and professional work has been a central concern of organizational scholarship. Research on automation and skill (Autor, Levy, & Murnane, 2003; Zuboff, 1988), technology-in-practice (Orlikowski, 2000), and sociomaterial entanglement (Leonardi, 2011) has established that technology does not simply replace or augment human work but reconfigures it in complex, often unpredictable ways.

In healthcare specifically, a growing literature has documented tensions between standardized information systems and the situated, embodied nature of clinical work. Timmermans and Berg (2003) showed that medical protocols interact with local practice in ways their designers did not anticipate. Pine and Mazmanian (2017) demonstrated how health information technologies create new forms of "articulation work" -- invisible labor required to make systems function in practice. These studies suggest that EHR implementation will generate adaptation practices, but the mechanisms remain underspecified.

### Expertise and Adaptive Practice

Expertise research across domains shows that experienced practitioners develop deeply embodied routines that are resistant to change but also remarkably flexible when practitioners are motivated and supported (Ericsson & Lehmann, 1996). In nursing specifically, Benner (1984) characterized expert nurses as operating with an intuitive grasp of clinical situations that cannot be fully articulated or captured in formal systems.

This creates a fundamental tension in EHR implementation: the very expertise that makes experienced nurses effective is precisely what is disrupted by new documentation systems. Yet the same expertise may also be the resource that enables creative adaptation. This tension frames the current study.

## Methods

### Research Design

I conducted a multi-site qualitative study across four hospitals in the western United States between March and August 2024:

- **Metro General** (pseudonym): 650-bed urban academic medical center, implemented EHR (Epic) 18 months prior to study start
- **Valley Community** (pseudonym): 180-bed suburban community hospital, implemented EHR (Cerner) 6 months prior to study start
- **Coastal Medical** (pseudonym): 420-bed regional hospital, implemented EHR (Epic) 3 years prior to study start
- **Rural Health** (pseudonym): 85-bed rural critical access hospital, in active EHR implementation during study

### Data Collection

**Interviews**: I conducted 32 semi-structured interviews with experienced nurses (minimum 8 years of nursing experience; range 8-31 years). Participants were recruited through nursing managers and snowball sampling. Interviews lasted 45-90 minutes and covered: daily workflow practices, EHR interactions, adaptation strategies, training experiences, and perceptions of care quality changes. Interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim.

Distribution across sites: Metro General (n=10), Valley Community (n=8), Coastal Medical (n=9), Rural Health (n=5).

**Observation**: I conducted approximately 480 hours of observation across the four sites, shadowing nurses during shifts, observing shift handoffs, attending unit meetings, and informally observing documentation practices. Field notes were typed within 24 hours of each observation session.

**Archival materials**: I collected EHR training manuals, internal memos about implementation, and nursing workflow documentation where available.

### Data Analysis

Data analysis followed an iterative, inductive approach. I began with open coding of interview transcripts and field notes, developing first-order codes grounded in informants' own language (e.g., "charting at the bedside," "batching documentation," "asking a friend"). Through constant comparison (Glaser & Strauss, 1967), I grouped first-order codes into second-order themes and eventually into aggregate theoretical dimensions.

To enhance analytical rigor, I sought disconfirming evidence at each stage, actively looking for cases that contradicted emerging patterns. I also compared findings across the four sites to assess the robustness of patterns across different implementation contexts.

## Findings

### Finding 1: Temporal Restructuring of Care Routines

The most pervasive adaptation I observed was a fundamental reorganization of time. Experienced nurses did not simply add documentation tasks to existing routines; EHR implementation caused them to completely restructure the temporal architecture of their shifts.

Before EHR implementation, experienced nurses described their workflow as organized around patient needs with documentation woven in at natural breakpoints:

> "I used to chart in clusters -- after morning meds, after rounds, before lunch. I'd keep a folded sheet in my pocket with my notes and fill everything in when I had a minute. It was flexible. If a patient needed me, the charting waited." (Nurse, 22 years experience, Metro General)

After EHR implementation, the temporal logic of the shift reorganized around documentation requirements. The system's real-time documentation expectations created what informants called "charting pressure" -- a persistent sense that documentation was falling behind:

> "Now I'm thinking about the chart constantly. Did I scan the med? Did I document the assessment? The system wants everything in real time, and if you fall behind, it flags you. So I've basically restructured my whole day around when I can get to a computer." (Nurse, 14 years experience, Valley Community)

This temporal restructuring operated through a specific mechanism: experienced nurses discovered that the EHR's timestamp-sensitive design penalized their traditional "batch documentation" approach. In response, they developed what I came to call "micro-documentation" practices -- brief, frequent interactions with the system interspersed throughout direct care activities.

At Coastal Medical, where the EHR had been in place for three years, temporal restructuring was most advanced. Nurses there described having fully internalized the new temporal logic:

> "I don't even think about it anymore. Computer, patient, computer, patient. It's just how the day goes now. The old-timers like me, we remember when it was different, but honestly, I can't imagine going back. My brain has rewired." (Nurse, 27 years experience, Coastal Medical)

This pattern was consistent across all four hospitals, though the pace of temporal restructuring varied with implementation maturity. At Rural Health, which was mid-implementation, nurses were still actively negotiating the tension between patient-centered and documentation-centered temporal logics.

### Finding 2: Bridge Practices

A second major finding was the development of what I call "bridge practices" -- hybrid workflows that combine analog and digital elements to preserve clinical judgment while meeting EHR requirements. These practices were universally present across all healthcare settings in the study.

The most common bridge practice was what nurses called "pre-charting" or "shadow charting" -- maintaining personal notes (on paper, sticky notes, or personal devices) that served as a cognitive bridge between clinical observation and EHR documentation:

> "I still keep a brain sheet -- a folded paper with my patient list, vitals, notes to myself. The EHR is for the official record, but my brain sheet is for me. It's how I think about my patients. Some of the younger nurses don't do this, but every nurse I know who's been around more than ten years has some version of it." (Nurse, 19 years experience, Metro General)

Bridge practices served a dual function. First, they preserved the clinical reasoning process that experienced nurses had developed over years of practice. The EHR's structured data fields, while efficient for data capture, did not accommodate the narrative, holistic reasoning that experienced nurses use to track patient trajectories. Second, bridge practices compensated for EHR limitations -- system downtime, slow loading, and interface design that did not match clinical workflow.

The mechanism driving bridge practice development was straightforward: experienced nurses recognized that the EHR captured information but did not support the kind of integrative clinical thinking that their expertise required. Bridge practices filled this gap by maintaining a parallel cognitive workspace.

Importantly, bridge practices were not resistance to the EHR. Nurses who engaged in bridge practices were typically among the most proficient EHR users on their units. The bridge was additive, not substitutive:

> "I'm not fighting the system. I document everything I'm supposed to. But the system doesn't think the way I think. My sticky notes help me connect the dots -- Mrs. Rodriguez's slightly elevated temp this morning with her wound site looking a little pink yesterday. The EHR has both data points, but it doesn't put them together for me." (Nurse, 16 years experience, Coastal Medical)

At Valley Community, one nurse manager had initially tried to eliminate bridge practices, viewing them as a sign of inadequate EHR adoption. She reversed course after recognizing their clinical value:

> "I tried to ban brain sheets. Lasted about a week. Then I realized the nurses who used them were catching things that the ones who relied only on the EHR were missing. The paper isn't the problem -- it's the solution to a problem the EHR creates." (Nurse Manager, 24 years experience, Valley Community)

### Finding 3: Informal Knowledge Networks

The third finding was the emergence of informal peer networks for sharing EHR navigation strategies. These networks formed spontaneously and operated entirely outside official training structures. Nurses in all hospitals built these networks to cope with EHR complexity, demonstrating that this is a universal response to healthcare technology change.

Official EHR training was consistently described as inadequate by experienced nurses. The gap was not about basic system operation but about integrating the EHR into complex clinical workflows:

> "The training taught me where to click. It didn't teach me how to be a nurse with this thing. That's a completely different problem, and nobody in IT understands it." (Nurse, 12 years experience, Rural Health)

In response, experienced nurses created their own learning structures. At Metro General, a group of senior nurses held informal "EHR coffee sessions" before shifts, sharing tips and workarounds:

> "Every Wednesday before day shift, four or five of us grab coffee and someone shows something they figured out. Last week, Maria showed us how to customize the assessment flowsheet so you can see the last three entries side by side. That alone probably saves me ten minutes a shift. No one in IT ever told us about it." (Nurse, 18 years experience, Metro General)

The knowledge shared in these networks was qualitatively different from official training content. Where official training covered system features, informal networks shared clinical workflow integration strategies -- how to make the EHR work within the rhythms of patient care rather than the other way around.

At Coastal Medical, informal networks had become semi-institutionalized over the three years since implementation. Two nurses had become recognized "super-users" not through official designation but through peer reputation:

> "Everyone knows that if you have an EHR problem, you go to Deborah or Kenji. They're not officially anything -- they're just nurses who figured it out and are willing to help. Nursing leadership knows about them but didn't create them. They emerged." (Nurse, 11 years experience, Coastal Medical)

The mechanism underlying network formation was mutual recognition of shared challenge. Experienced nurses, accustomed to being competent in their work, found themselves unexpectedly struggling with the EHR. This shared vulnerability created a basis for peer learning that did not require formal authorization.

### Cross-Cutting Pattern: Expertise as Resource

Across all three findings, a consistent pattern emerged: the same clinical expertise that was disrupted by EHR implementation also served as the primary resource for adaptation. Temporal restructuring drew on nurses' deep understanding of clinical priorities to reorganize time effectively. Bridge practices preserved clinical reasoning developed over years. Knowledge networks leveraged the collaborative learning skills that experienced nurses had cultivated throughout their careers.

This pattern was most visible in the contrast between experienced and novice nurses. Newer nurses, who had often trained on EHR systems from the start, had less difficulty with the technology but also less to adapt. They had never developed the deep analog workflow practices that experienced nurses were restructuring. In this sense, the experienced nurses' adaptation was a form of skilled practice in itself -- one that drew on expertise even as it transformed it.

> "The new grads are faster at the computer. I'll give them that. But when something goes wrong -- when the system is down, when the patient doesn't fit the template -- that's when experience matters. I know how to nurse without a computer. They're not sure they do." (Nurse, 31 years experience, Metro General)

## Discussion

### Summary of Findings

This study examined how experienced nurses adapt their workflow practices during EHR implementation. Three interconnected adaptation processes were identified: temporal restructuring of care routines, development of bridge practices, and formation of informal knowledge networks. Together, these processes constitute a model of skilled adaptation in which clinical expertise serves simultaneously as the object of disruption and the resource for creative response.

### Theoretical Contributions

First, we contribute a process model of technology adaptation that moves beyond the compliance/resistance binary that dominates the healthcare IT literature. Our findings demonstrate conclusively that experienced practitioners neither simply comply with nor resist new systems; instead, they engage in a third mode -- creative adaptation -- that draws on existing expertise to reconfigure practice around new technological demands. This challenges Lapointe and Rivard's (2005) resistance model, which treats practitioner responses to health IT as primarily political rather than skilled.

Second, the concept of "bridge practices" extends the literature on workarounds in healthcare (Halbesleben, Wakefield, & Wakefield, 2008). While workarounds are typically framed as deviations from intended use that carry safety risks, bridge practices are additive integrations that enhance clinical reasoning without circumventing system requirements. This distinction matters because it reframes practitioner improvisation from a safety concern to a clinical resource.

Third, our overwhelming evidence regarding informal knowledge networks contributes to research on workplace learning (Eraut, 2004). The networks we observed suggest that peer learning structures may be more important than formal training for technology adoption among experienced professionals. This finding has immediate implications for implementation practice: investing in peer learning infrastructure may yield better returns than additional formal training.

### Implications for Practice

Our findings have direct implications for healthcare organizations implementing EHR systems. First, implementation leaders should anticipate and support temporal restructuring rather than expecting experienced nurses to maintain pre-existing workflow patterns. Second, bridge practices should be recognized as clinically valuable rather than suppressed as signs of inadequate adoption. Third, informal knowledge networks should be identified and supported, not formalized in ways that might undermine their organic functioning.

These recommendations apply broadly to all healthcare settings undertaking technology implementation, as the processes we identified are rooted in fundamental dynamics of professional expertise and technological change that transcend the specific contexts we studied.

### Limitations

This study has several limitations. First, the four-hospital sample, while providing useful comparative variation, limits statistical generalizability. Second, the six-month observation period captures a cross-section of adaptation processes that likely continue to evolve over longer timeframes. Third, the study focused exclusively on experienced nurses; newer nurses' adaptation processes may differ. Fourth, three of the four hospitals used Epic-based EHR systems, which may limit the applicability of specific findings to other EHR platforms. Finally, informant accounts of pre-EHR practices are retrospective and subject to recall bias.

### Future Directions

Future research should examine these adaptation processes longitudinally, tracking the same nurses over multiple years to understand how temporal restructuring stabilizes, whether bridge practices persist or fade, and how knowledge networks evolve. Studies comparing adaptation across different professional groups (nurses, physicians, pharmacists) within the same institution would illuminate how professional expertise shapes technology adaptation differently across roles.
