# D7 Overclaim Paper: Answer Key

## Overview

**Source**: `d7-overclaim-paper.md`
**Target Domain**: Domain 7 (Claim Verification & Integrity), Levels 2 and 3
**Total overclaims seeded**: 10 (3 causal, 3 scope, 2 mechanism, 2 evidence-strength)
**Properly calibrated claims**: 4

The paper presents solid qualitative fieldwork on nurses adapting to EHR implementation. The observations are interesting, the quotes feel real, and the theoretical framing is reasonable. The problems are entirely in how claims are calibrated to evidence. The researcher did good work but doesn't yet know how to match claim strength to evidence strength. A student assessing this paper needs to distinguish overclaim problems (framing) from content problems (substance) -- the substance is fine.

## Overclaims

### OC-1: Causal overclaim -- "caused them to completely restructure"

- **Location**: Finding 1, second paragraph
- **Exact text**: `EHR implementation caused them to completely restructure the temporal architecture of their shifts.`
- **Type**: Causal
- **Why it's an overclaim**: This is qualitative, cross-sectional data. Nurses report that their shifts changed after EHR implementation, but "caused" asserts a causal link that this study design cannot establish. Other factors may have changed simultaneously (staffing ratios, patient acuity, policy changes). Nurses' retrospective accounts of pre-EHR practice are also subject to recall bias -- they may be constructing a cleaner before/after narrative than actually existed. The study can show that temporal restructuring *accompanied* or *followed* EHR implementation, not that EHR implementation *caused* it.
- **Suggested revision**: "After EHR implementation, experienced nurses reported completely restructuring the temporal architecture of their shifts" or "EHR implementation was accompanied by a fundamental reorganization of temporal routines."
- **Difficulty**: Medium. The causal language is embedded in a findings paragraph that reads naturally, and "caused" appears in the middle of a sentence rather than as a standalone claim. Students need to notice the causal assertion and question whether the study design supports it.

### OC-2: Scope overclaim -- "universally present across all healthcare settings"

- **Location**: Finding 2, first paragraph
- **Exact text**: `These practices were universally present across all healthcare settings in the study.`
- **Type**: Scope
- **Why it's an overclaim**: "All healthcare settings" implies generalizability far beyond the four hospitals studied. The researcher likely means "all four hospitals in our sample," but the phrasing suggests universality across healthcare settings generally. Even "universally present" across just four hospitals overstates -- the researcher observed bridge practices at all sites, but "universally" implies no exceptions among any nurses at any site, which the data almost certainly don't show.
- **Suggested revision**: "Bridge practices were present at all four hospitals in the study, though their specific forms varied by site and individual."
- **Difficulty**: Easy. "Universally" and "all healthcare settings" are clear red flag phrases that over-scope beyond the sample.

### OC-3: Mechanism overclaim -- "The mechanism driving bridge practice development was straightforward"

- **Location**: Finding 2, fourth paragraph
- **Exact text**: `The mechanism driving bridge practice development was straightforward: experienced nurses recognized that the EHR captured information but did not support the kind of integrative clinical thinking that their expertise required. Bridge practices filled this gap by maintaining a parallel cognitive workspace.`
- **Type**: Mechanism
- **Why it's an overclaim**: The researcher observed a *pattern* (nurses using bridge practices) and informants *described* their reasoning for doing so. But this is not the same as identifying a mechanism. A mechanism would require showing the causal process through which recognition of EHR limitations leads to bridge practice development. The researcher has informants' post-hoc accounts of why they do what they do -- revealed justifications, not observed mechanisms. Multiple mechanisms could produce the same pattern: habit persistence, peer imitation, anxiety reduction, etc.
- **Suggested revision**: "Informants described a consistent rationale for bridge practice development: they perceived that the EHR captured information but did not support integrative clinical thinking. Whether this reported rationale reflects the actual generative process -- or whether other factors like habit persistence or peer imitation also contribute -- requires further investigation."
- **Difficulty**: Hard. The word "mechanism" is used correctly in the technical sense, and the description sounds plausible. The student needs to understand the distinction between a reported rationale and an observed mechanism -- between what informants *say* drives their behavior and what *actually* drives it.

### OC-4: Scope overclaim -- "Nurses in all hospitals built these networks"

- **Location**: Finding 3, first paragraph
- **Exact text**: `Nurses in all hospitals built these networks to cope with EHR complexity, demonstrating that this is a universal response to healthcare technology change.`
- **Type**: Scope
- **Why it's an overclaim**: The leap from "all four hospitals in my sample" to "universal response to healthcare technology change" is enormous. The researcher studied four specific hospitals during EHR implementation. Claiming universality -- across all types of healthcare technology change, in all settings, for all types of practitioners -- is wildly beyond what four hospitals can support. The first clause is fine (nurses at all four sites did build networks); the second clause is the overclaim.
- **Suggested revision**: "Nurses at all four hospitals developed these networks, suggesting that informal peer learning may be a common response to technology change in nursing -- though the generality of this pattern beyond EHR implementation and these specific contexts remains to be established."
- **Difficulty**: Easy. "Universal response to healthcare technology change" from a four-hospital study is a textbook scope overclaim.

### OC-5: Causal overclaim -- "EHR implementation caused them to completely restructure" (Discussion framing)

- **Location**: Discussion, Theoretical Contributions, first paragraph
- **Exact text**: `Our findings demonstrate conclusively that experienced practitioners neither simply comply with nor resist new systems`
- **Type**: Evidence-strength
- **Why it's an overclaim**: "Demonstrate conclusively" claims a level of certainty that qualitative research from four hospitals cannot provide. A qualitative study can *suggest*, *indicate*, or *provide evidence consistent with* a claim. "Demonstrate conclusively" implies there is no room for alternative interpretations, which is never the case in qualitative research. The finding itself is interesting and well-supported -- the overclaim is in the strength marker "conclusively."
- **Suggested revision**: "Our findings suggest that experienced practitioners neither simply comply with nor resist new systems" or "Our findings provide evidence that a third mode of response -- creative adaptation -- warrants further attention."
- **Difficulty**: Medium. "Conclusively" is a clear red flag word, but it's buried in a Discussion paragraph where students may be less vigilant. The student needs to ask: can a four-hospital qualitative study "conclusively demonstrate" anything?

### OC-6: Evidence-strength overclaim -- "overwhelming evidence"

- **Location**: Discussion, Theoretical Contributions, third paragraph
- **Exact text**: `our overwhelming evidence regarding informal knowledge networks contributes to research on workplace learning`
- **Type**: Evidence-strength
- **Why it's an overclaim**: "Overwhelming evidence" from 32 interviews and 480 hours of observation at four hospitals is not overwhelming. The evidence is substantial and interesting, but "overwhelming" implies a volume and consistency that would leave no room for doubt. 32 interviews is a reasonable qualitative sample -- it's not "overwhelming." The researcher is inflating the evidence description to strengthen the contribution claim.
- **Suggested revision**: "our findings regarding informal knowledge networks contribute to research on workplace learning" or "the consistent presence of informal knowledge networks across all four sites contributes to research on workplace learning."
- **Difficulty**: Easy. "Overwhelming" applied to 32 interviews is a clear mismatch between evidence description and actual evidence base.

### OC-7: Scope overclaim -- "apply broadly to all healthcare settings"

- **Location**: Discussion, Implications for Practice, second paragraph
- **Exact text**: `These recommendations apply broadly to all healthcare settings undertaking technology implementation, as the processes we identified are rooted in fundamental dynamics of professional expertise and technological change that transcend the specific contexts we studied.`
- **Type**: Scope
- **Why it's an overclaim**: The researcher generalizes from four hospitals to "all healthcare settings" and claims the processes "transcend" the studied contexts. This is a massive scope leap. The patterns observed may well generalize, but a four-hospital qualitative study cannot establish that they apply to "all healthcare settings." The claim that the dynamics are "fundamental" and "transcend" specific contexts is theoretical speculation presented as empirical finding.
- **Suggested revision**: "These recommendations may be relevant to other healthcare settings undertaking technology implementation, particularly those with experienced nursing staff facing similar documentation system changes, though the applicability beyond the contexts we studied requires further investigation."
- **Difficulty**: Easy. The language ("all healthcare settings," "transcend") makes the scope overclaim explicit.

### OC-8: Causal overclaim -- "EHR's timestamp-sensitive design penalized"

- **Location**: Finding 1, fourth paragraph
- **Exact text**: `experienced nurses discovered that the EHR's timestamp-sensitive design penalized their traditional "batch documentation" approach`
- **Type**: Causal
- **Why it's an overclaim**: "Penalized" implies an intentional design consequence, and the sentence frames a causal chain (timestamp design -> penalty -> micro-documentation). But the researcher observed nurses changing behavior and nurses *reporting* that the timestamp system was the reason. The researcher did not independently verify that the timestamp system actually penalized batch documentation, or that this was the reason nurses changed behavior (vs. manager pressure, peer norms, training messaging, etc.). The claimed causal chain is plausible but not demonstrated.
- **Suggested revision**: "experienced nurses perceived that the EHR's timestamp-sensitive design was incompatible with their traditional 'batch documentation' approach" or "nurses reported that timestamp requirements pressured them away from batch documentation."
- **Difficulty**: Hard. "Penalized" reads naturally and the causal claim is embedded in a narrative about what nurses "discovered." The student needs to recognize that informants' causal accounts are not the same as researcher-verified causal claims.

### OC-9: Mechanism overclaim -- "The mechanism underlying network formation was mutual recognition"

- **Location**: Finding 3, sixth paragraph
- **Exact text**: `The mechanism underlying network formation was mutual recognition of shared challenge. Experienced nurses, accustomed to being competent in their work, found themselves unexpectedly struggling with the EHR. This shared vulnerability created a basis for peer learning that did not require formal authorization.`
- **Type**: Mechanism
- **Why it's an overclaim**: Same issue as OC-3. The researcher observed that networks formed and that nurses described shared challenge as the basis. But claiming this as "the mechanism" implies the researcher identified the causal process, when they actually observed a pattern and collected informants' accounts of it. "Mutual recognition of shared challenge" is one plausible driver; others include pre-existing social ties, spatial proximity, shift scheduling, and managerial encouragement (or lack thereof). Presenting one informant-reported factor as "the mechanism" overstates what the data show.
- **Suggested revision**: "Informants consistently described mutual recognition of shared challenge as a key factor in network formation. Experienced nurses, accustomed to being competent, found themselves unexpectedly struggling -- and this shared vulnerability appeared to create a basis for peer learning. However, other factors likely contributed, including pre-existing relationships and shared shift schedules."
- **Difficulty**: Medium. The word "mechanism" is the red flag, but the description is plausible and well-written. Students need to apply the pattern/mechanism distinction from the competency materials.

### OC-10: Causal + scope hybrid -- Abstract's "fundamentally transforms"

- **Location**: Abstract
- **Exact text**: `Our findings provide strong evidence that EHR implementation fundamentally transforms nursing practice`
- **Type**: Evidence-strength (with causal undertones)
- **Why it's an overclaim**: Two problems. First, "strong evidence" overstates the evidence base -- 32 interviews and observation at four hospitals is *evidence*, but characterizing it as "strong" inflates its weight. Second, "fundamentally transforms nursing practice" generalizes from the four hospitals to nursing practice in general, and "fundamentally" implies a depth and permanence of change that a six-month study cannot establish. The finding that nurses adapt their practices is well-supported; the claim that EHR implementation "fundamentally transforms nursing practice" as a general proposition exceeds the evidence.
- **Suggested revision**: "Our findings suggest that EHR implementation substantially reshapes the workflow practices of experienced nurses" or "Our findings indicate that experienced nurses' practices change in structured ways following EHR implementation."
- **Difficulty**: Medium. The abstract is where students should be most alert to overclaiming, but "strong evidence" and "fundamentally transforms" are moderate rather than extreme overclaims. The student needs to assess whether the evidence base warrants "strong" and whether the scope warrants "nursing practice" (vs. "nursing practice at the hospitals we studied").

## Properly Calibrated Claims (NOT overclaims)

Students should NOT flag the following:

### CC-1: "This pattern was consistent across all four hospitals"

- **Location**: Finding 1, last paragraph
- **Exact text**: `This pattern was consistent across all four hospitals, though the pace of temporal restructuring varied with implementation maturity.`
- **Why it's fine**: The claim is scoped to the four hospitals in the study. "Consistent across all four hospitals" is a factual statement about the sample, not a generalization beyond it. The qualifier "though the pace varied" shows appropriate calibration -- acknowledging within-sample variation rather than claiming uniformity.

### CC-2: "Nurses who engaged in bridge practices were typically among the most proficient EHR users"

- **Location**: Finding 2, fifth paragraph
- **Exact text**: `Nurses who engaged in bridge practices were typically among the most proficient EHR users on their units. The bridge was additive, not substitutive.`
- **Why it's fine**: "Typically" is appropriately hedged -- not "always" or "invariably." The claim is descriptive (what the researcher observed) rather than causal (bridge practices don't "cause" proficiency). The interpretive claim ("additive, not substitutive") is presented as the researcher's characterization, not as an empirical finding with independent verification.

### CC-3: "The knowledge shared in these networks was qualitatively different from official training content"

- **Location**: Finding 3, fourth paragraph
- **Exact text**: `The knowledge shared in these networks was qualitatively different from official training content. Where official training covered system features, informal networks shared clinical workflow integration strategies.`
- **Why it's fine**: This is a descriptive comparison based on direct observation of both official training and informal network interactions. The researcher observed what was taught in training and what was shared in networks, and is reporting a difference. The claim is appropriately scoped to what was observed.

### CC-4: "The new grads are faster at the computer" comparison

- **Location**: Cross-Cutting Pattern section, last quote and surrounding text
- **Exact text**: The entire paragraph about experienced vs. novice nurses, including the quote from the 31-year nurse.
- **Why it's fine**: This is presented as an informant's observation, not a researcher claim. The surrounding text frames it as a "pattern" that "was most visible in the contrast" -- appropriately tentative language for a qualitative observation. The researcher does not claim to have measured speed differences or established that experience causes different adaptation patterns.

| Category | Count | IDs |
|----------|-------|-----|
| Causal overclaims | 3 | OC-1, OC-8, OC-10 (partial) |
| Scope overclaims | 3 | OC-2, OC-4, OC-7 |
| Mechanism overclaims | 2 | OC-3, OC-9 |
| Evidence-strength overclaims | 2 | OC-5, OC-6 |
| Properly calibrated claims | 4 | CC-1, CC-2, CC-3, CC-4 |
| **Total seeded items** | **14** | (10 overclaims + 4 calibrated) |

### Difficulty Distribution

- **Easy**: OC-2, OC-4, OC-6, OC-7 (4 overclaims)
- **Medium**: OC-1, OC-5, OC-9, OC-10 (4 overclaims)
- **Hard**: OC-3, OC-8 (2 overclaims)

A student who finds only the easy overclaims is demonstrating surface-level claim-evidence calibration awareness (Level 1 competency). A student who also catches the medium overclaims is applying calibration systematically (Level 2). A student who catches the hard overclaims -- particularly the mechanism overclaims (OC-3, OC-9) and the embedded causal claim (OC-8) -- is demonstrating expert-level calibration skill (Level 3).

## Common False Positives (Things Students Might Flag Incorrectly)

1. **The methods section describing inductive, iterative analysis.** This is methodologically appropriate and not an overclaim. Describing your analytical approach accurately is not the same as overclaiming findings.

2. **The use of direct quotes from informants.** Quotes are evidence. Using quotes is not overclaiming -- the overclaim is in how the researcher interprets and frames what the quotes show.

3. **The limitations section.** Students should not flag the limitations section as containing overclaims. The limitations section is where the researcher appropriately acknowledges weaknesses. If anything, the limitations section is the most honestly calibrated part of the paper.

4. **The concept "bridge practices" itself.** Naming an observed pattern is not overclaiming. The overclaim is in claiming to have identified the *mechanism* behind bridge practices (OC-3), not in naming the phenomenon.

5. **The theoretical background section's review of prior work.** Summarizing what other researchers found is not overclaiming (unless the student is claiming the *cited* research overclaimed, which is a different issue). The overclaims are in the Findings and Discussion, where the current researcher's claims meet the current researcher's evidence.

6. **Informant quotes themselves.** If a nurse says "my brain has rewired," that is the informant's subjective description of their experience. The researcher is not overclaiming by including this quote -- the overclaim would be if the researcher claimed that EHR use *literally* rewires neural pathways.

## Scoring Guidance

### Level 2 Assessment (Application with Feedback)

Using the rubric from ASSESSMENT_SPECS.md:

**Score = (found x 40) - (false_pos x 20) + (calibration x 40)**

Where:
- `found` = |student overclaims found that match expert list| / |expert overclaims| (proportion, 0-1)
- `false_pos` = |student "overclaims" not in expert list| / |student total claims| (proportion, 0-1)
- `calibration` = holistic assessment of revision quality (proportion, 0-1)

**Example scoring**:
- Student finds 7 of 10 overclaims, flags 1 false positive (8 total flags): found = 0.7, false_pos = 0.125
  - Score = (0.7 x 40) - (0.125 x 20) + (calibration x 40) = 28 - 2.5 + calibration_component
  - If calibration = 0.8: Score = 28 - 2.5 + 32 = 57.5 (borderline, depends on calibration)
  - If calibration = 0.9: Score = 28 - 2.5 + 36 = 61.5

**Passing**: >= 70/100 (per ASSESSMENT_SPECS.md for Level 2)

### Level 3 Assessment (Authentic Performance)

Same scoring but no feedback during assessment. Student receives only the paper and instructions. Must find >= 50% of overclaims (>= 5 of 10) to avoid floor failure.

## Notes for Assessors

- The paper is intentionally competent in its substance. The fieldwork is solid, the quotes are realistic, and the observations are genuinely interesting. This is by design: students need to distinguish overclaim problems (how claims are framed relative to evidence) from content problems (whether the observations themselves are valuable). A student who dismisses the whole paper as "bad research" is missing the point.

- The mechanism overclaims (OC-3, OC-9) are the hardest to catch because they sound right. The researcher observed a pattern and informants explained it -- that feels like a mechanism. The distinction between "informants reported X as the reason" and "the mechanism is X" is subtle but central to Domain 7 competency. Students who catch these are demonstrating genuine claim-evidence calibration skill.

- The causal overclaim embedded in Finding 1 (OC-1) uses "caused" in the middle of a descriptive passage. Students who only scan for overclaims in the Discussion section will miss it. Expert-level overclaim detection requires reading the Findings section with the same critical eye as the Discussion.

- The properly calibrated claims (CC-1 through CC-4) are deliberately placed near overclaims. A student who flags everything as an overclaim is demonstrating poor precision, not thoroughness. The assessment should reward students who can tell the difference.

- The abstract (OC-10) concentrates multiple overclaim types in a single sentence. Students may flag it as one overclaim or decompose it into multiple. Either approach is acceptable as long as the student identifies both the evidence-strength problem ("strong evidence") and the scope problem ("fundamentally transforms nursing practice").
