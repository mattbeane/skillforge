## Section A: Multiple Choice (10 questions)

### Question 1
A researcher has a strong finding about how surgical trainees learn informally. They frame it as an extension of situated learning theory. Their advisor says "generate two more framings." Why?

- a) To pad the paper with more theoretical breadth
- b) The first framing is usually the most obvious, not the most compelling — alternatives might reveal a stronger angle, different audience, or better journal fit
- c) To demonstrate to reviewers that they considered other options
- d) Advisors always request more work

**Correct**: b
**Why**: Multiple framings force you to see angles you'd otherwise miss. The first framing you think of reflects your default theoretical home — not necessarily the strongest positioning for this finding.

---

### Question 2
Which of the following represents THREE genuinely distinct framings of the same finding ("experienced workers develop workarounds when technology degrades")?

- a) (1) "Workers adapt to degrading technology" / (2) "Employees adjust when tools get worse" / (3) "Staff find workarounds for bad equipment"
- b) (1) Extension of routine dynamics theory: routines don't just persist — they actively reconfigure around degrading tools / (2) Contribution to occupational skill theory: experienced workers convert degraded tools into learning opportunities for juniors / (3) Challenge to technology management: organizations underinvest in maintenance because skilled users mask degradation through workarounds
- c) (1) Organizational behavior framing / (2) Sociology framing / (3) Management framing

**Correct**: b
**Why**: Option (a) is the same idea in different words. Option (c) names disciplines, not framings. Option (b) has three genuinely different theories, audiences, and contributions.

---

### Question 3
A framing has high novelty but the evidence only weakly supports it. Another framing is less novel but the evidence strongly supports it. Which should you choose?

- a) The novel one — novelty is what gets published
- b) The well-supported one — you can't publish claims your data doesn't support, regardless of novelty
- c) Neither — find a third option
- d) Combine them into one paper

**Correct**: b
**Why**: Reviewers will accept a moderately novel claim backed by strong evidence. They will reject a highly novel claim with weak evidence. Evidence-framing fit beats novelty every time.

---

### Question 4
What makes a hook effective for an ASQ paper?

- a) It reviews the relevant literature comprehensively
- b) It creates a puzzle or surprise that makes the reader want to know the answer
- c) It describes the study's methodology
- d) It states all contributions upfront

**Correct**: b
**Why**: A hook creates intellectual suspense. It makes the reader curious: "That's surprising — why does that happen?" Literature reviews, methods, and contribution lists don't create curiosity.

---

### Question 5
Evaluate this hook: "Prior research has examined technology adoption in various organizational settings. This paper examines technology adoption in hospitals."

- a) It's fine — clearly states the topic
- b) It's weak — it frames around context ("hospitals") rather than around a puzzle, and the reader has no reason to care about yet another context for technology adoption
- c) It just needs stronger language
- d) It needs more citations

**Correct**: b
**Why**: "I studied X in new context Y" isn't compelling unless Y reveals something theoretically surprising. The hook should start with a puzzle, not with what the paper studies.

---

### Question 6
When evaluating a theoretical framing, which dimension asks "Does the evidence actually support this angle?"

- a) Novelty
- b) Robustness
- c) Coherence
- d) Fit

**Correct**: b
**Why**: Robustness means your data can bear the weight of the framing's claims. A framing with poor robustness promises something the evidence can't deliver.

---

### Question 7
A researcher's contribution statement reads: "We contribute to the literature on organizational change by investigating digital transformation in manufacturing." What's wrong?

- a) Nothing — it's clear
- b) It uses the empty verb "investigating" — it says what the paper studied, not what it found or what it changes in our understanding
- c) It needs to mention the theory being extended
- d) It should be longer

**Correct**: b
**Why**: Contribution statements must state what changes in our understanding. "Investigating" is doing, not contributing. Better: "We show that digital transformation fractures established routines in manufacturing — but only routines involving tacit coordination — challenging the assumption that automation disrupts all work equally."

---

### Question 8
What does "counter-argument anticipation" mean in framing?

- a) Arguing against your own finding
- b) Imagining what a skeptical reviewer would say about your framing and preparing a genuine response — not a straw man
- c) Including a limitations section
- d) Responding to previous reviewers' comments

**Correct**: b
**Why**: Good framing includes knowing where the attacks will come from. If you can't name the strongest objection to your framing, you don't understand it well enough. Straw man objections waste everyone's time.

---

### Question 9
A researcher frames their finding about informal learning as extending "communities of practice" theory. Their advisor asks: "Would a reviewer buy this?" The researcher says: "Of course — communities of practice is a well-known theory." What's the advisor really asking?

- a) Whether the researcher has cited enough papers
- b) Whether the finding genuinely violates or extends a prediction made by CoP theory — or whether the researcher is just name-dropping a theory that feels adjacent
- c) Whether the reviewer has heard of the theory
- d) Whether the theory is too old

**Correct**: b
**Why**: "Does this theory predict something your finding contradicts?" is the test. Merely being related to the theory isn't enough — the finding must do something to the theory (extend, violate, complicate). Name-dropping a famous theory without this moves the framing from positioning to decoration.

---

### Question 10
Which journal consideration matters MOST when choosing between framings?

- a) Which journal has the fastest turnaround
- b) Whether the framing's contribution type and evidence standard match the journal's genre expectations — e.g., Management Science values empirical robustness; ASQ values theory-building depth
- c) Which journal has the highest impact factor
- d) Where your advisor has published before

**Correct**: b
**Why**: Journal fit means your framing's strengths match what the journal rewards. A robust finding with moderate theoretical novelty fits Management Science better than ASQ. A deep theoretical reframing with rich qualitative evidence fits ASQ better than Management Science. Wrong fit → desk rejection.

## Section B: Short Answer (2 questions)

### Question 11
A researcher finds that AI-assisted medical diagnoses are less accurate when experienced doctors use them than when novice doctors use them. Generate TWO genuinely distinct framings for this finding. For each, name: (1) the theory being violated or extended, (2) the target audience (row or column), and (3) one counter-argument a reviewer might raise.

**Model answer should include two framings such as**:

**Framing A — Expertise theory violation (column)**:
- Theory: Expert performance theory predicts experience improves outcomes. But here experience + AI produces WORSE outcomes than novice + AI.
- Audience: Column — expertise/skill scholars (people who study how experts think)
- Counter-argument: "Maybe the experienced doctors are ignoring the AI and relying on their own (wrong) judgment" — which is an interesting mechanism worth investigating, not a dismissal.

**Framing B — Technology augmentation failure (row)**:
- Theory: Augmentation thesis claims AI enhances human capabilities. But for experts, it degrades them — suggesting AI disrupts established expert heuristics.
- Audience: Row — people who care about AI in medicine specifically
- Counter-argument: "Maybe the experts were assigned harder cases" — a selection effect that would need to be ruled out empirically.

Key: framings should differ on theory, audience, or contribution type — not just wording.

### Question 12
A colleague shows you their paper's abstract. It reads: "Drawing on institutional theory, we examine how hospitals adopt electronic health records. Using data from 12 hospitals, we find that adoption varies by hospital size. We contribute to institutional theory and the literature on healthcare IT."

Identify at least THREE problems with this abstract from a framing perspective.

**Model answer should include any 3 of**:
- No puzzle or surprise — "adoption varies" isn't interesting unless it contradicts a specific prediction
- "Drawing on" is passive — it doesn't say what institutional theory predicts or how the finding violates/extends it
- "We examine" is an empty verb — says what was studied, not what was found
- "Adoption varies by hospital size" — so what? This is descriptive. What's the mechanism? What's theoretically surprising about this?
- "We contribute to institutional theory and the literature on healthcare IT" — this is two vague claims, neither of which states what actually changes in our understanding
- No mechanism or explanation — just a correlation (size → adoption) without a "why"
- No hook — nothing makes the reader want to read this paper
- Trying to serve two audiences (institutional theory AND healthcare IT) without committing to either
