## Section A: Multiple Choice (10 questions)

### Question 1
A researcher conducted 50 interviews, noticed a surprising pattern, and then found a theory that explained it. They write: "Based on social identity theory, we hypothesize that workers will resist technology that threatens their professional identity (H1)." What's wrong?

- a) The hypothesis is poorly stated
- b) This is a genre violation — the research was inductive (discovery) but the writing is deductive (testing). The researcher discovered the pattern and then found the theory, but is framing it as if the theory came first
- c) They need more hypotheses
- d) Social identity theory is the wrong theory

**Correct**: b
**Why**: The temporal logic is reversed. The researcher didn't start with social identity theory and test it — they found the pattern first. Writing it as a hypothesis misrepresents the epistemic process. Discovery research should use discovery framing.

### Question 2
Classify each phrase as appropriate for Discovery (D) or Testing (T) papers:

| Phrase | Genre |
|--------|-------|
| "I came to see that workers were developing informal workarounds" | ? |
| "As predicted by H2, the interaction effect was significant" | ? |
| "The data revealed an unexpected pattern" | ? |
| "Results confirm our theoretical predictions" | ? |
| "I was struck by how frequently informants described..." | ? |

- a) D, T, D, T, D
- b) D, T, T, T, D
- c) D, D, D, T, D
- d) T, T, D, T, D

**Correct**: a
**Why**: "I came to see," "data revealed," and "I was struck by" signal discovery. "As predicted by H2" and "Results confirm" signal testing. Using testing language in discovery papers is the most common genre violation.

---

### Question 3
Which section header is a red flag in an ASQ theory-building paper?

- a) "Theoretical Background"
- b) "Sensitizing Concepts"
- c) "Hypothesis Development"
- d) "Findings"

**Correct**: c
**Why**: "Hypothesis Development" signals deductive, theory-testing research. ASQ strongly prefers theory-building. If you're building theory inductively, you don't have formal hypotheses — you have sensitizing concepts, guiding questions, or theoretical background.

---

### Question 4
A researcher writes: "Consistent with our prediction, we found that team diversity increased innovation." But their research was exploratory — they had no prior prediction. What type of genre violation is this?

- a) Structural violation
- b) Language violation
- c) Temporal logic violation — they are presenting a discovered finding as if it were predicted a priori
- d) Citation violation

**Correct**: c
**Why**: Temporal logic means the paper should read in the order the researcher actually learned things. "Consistent with our prediction" implies the prediction came first. If it didn't, this is HARKing (Hypothesizing After Results are Known) — one of the most damaging genre violations.

---

### Question 5
What is the key difference between theory-building and theory-testing papers?

- a) Theory-building uses qualitative data; theory-testing uses quantitative data
- b) In theory-building, the theory emerges from observation; in theory-testing, the theory precedes observation and generates predictions to be confirmed or disconfirmed
- c) Theory-building is less rigorous than theory-testing
- d) Theory-building doesn't cite existing literature

**Correct**: b
**Why**: The distinction is about epistemic direction, not method or rigor. You can build theory quantitatively (exploratory data analysis) and test theory qualitatively (structured case comparisons). The question is whether theory came before or after the data.

---

### Question 6
A paper in Organization Science uses qualitative data from fieldwork. It includes "H1: Technological uncertainty increases coordination costs" and "H2: Coordination costs are moderated by team experience." What should you suspect?

- a) The paper is well-structured
- b) The researcher may be writing inductively-discovered patterns as if they were deductive hypotheses — a genre mismatch for qualitative fieldwork in Organization Science
- c) The hypotheses need to be stronger
- d) Organization Science doesn't publish qualitative papers

**Correct**: b
**Why**: Numbered hypotheses with qualitative fieldwork is a red flag. If you did ethnography or interviews and then "derived" formal hypotheses, you probably discovered the patterns and are retrofitting a testing frame. Organization Science will catch this.

---

### Question 7
Rewrite this testing-genre sentence in discovery framing: "Theory predicts that uncertainty should reduce learning. Our data confirm this prediction."

- a) "Theory predicted learning would decrease under uncertainty. It did."
- b) "The relationship between uncertainty and learning was significant."
- c) "I expected uncertainty would reduce learning — and indeed the data showed a consistent pattern across sites where uncertainty was high and learning was suppressed."
- d) "As I observed surgeons working under conditions of high uncertainty, I noticed that learning opportunities were systematically reduced — a pattern that became clearer as I compared across sites."

**Correct**: d
**Why**: Discovery framing uses observational language ("I noticed," "became clearer"), doesn't claim prediction, and describes the epistemic journey. Option (c) still uses "I expected" which implies prior theory — acceptable only if the researcher genuinely had that expectation before seeing data.

---

### Question 8
What is the appropriate structure for a discovery paper's theory/background section?

- a) Hypothesis Development: Derive H1, H2, H3 from theory
- b) Theoretical Framework: Present sensitizing concepts that guided observation, without deriving testable predictions
- c) Results: Go straight to findings — discovery papers don't need a theory section
- d) Literature Review: Comprehensive review of everything written on the topic

**Correct**: b
**Why**: Discovery papers use theory as a sensitizing lens, not a source of predictions. The theory section provides the conceptual tools that helped the researcher make sense of observations — without pretending those observations were predicted.

---

### Question 9
A reviewer writes: "The authors claim to build theory, but the paper reads as if they knew their findings before they started." What is the reviewer detecting?

- a) Poor writing quality
- b) A genre violation: the paper's temporal logic doesn't match its stated epistemology — discovery claims but testing presentation
- c) The authors didn't do enough analysis
- d) The paper needs more citations

**Correct**: b
**Why**: This is the classic genre mismatch. Reviewers sense inauthenticity when a paper claims to discover something but presents it with the confidence and structure of pre-planned research. The solution is to write authentically about how insights actually emerged.

---

### Question 10
Which journal convention is CORRECT?

- a) AMJ requires discovery framing for all qualitative papers
- b) ASQ prefers theory-testing with formal hypotheses
- c) Management Science is comfortable with testing genre but still expects discovery papers to use discovery framing
- d) All journals prefer the same genre conventions

**Correct**: c
**Why**: Management Science is the most testing-friendly of the top journals, but it still expects genre consistency. If your research was exploratory, frame it that way even in Management Science. ASQ and Organization Science are more theory-building oriented. AMJ traditionally favors hypotheses but accepts inductive papers if they use the right framing.

## Section B: Short Answer (2 questions)

### Question 11
A paper abstract reads: "Drawing on organizational learning theory, we hypothesize that AI adoption will decrease worker skill development (H1) and that this effect is moderated by task complexity (H2). Using ethnographic data from 18 months of fieldwork in three hospitals, we find support for both hypotheses."

Identify the genre violation and explain why it matters. Then rewrite the abstract in the appropriate genre.

**Model answer should include**:
- The violation: Formal hypotheses (H1, H2) derived from theory + ethnographic fieldwork = genre mismatch. You don't do 18 months of ethnography to "test" two hypotheses. The researcher almost certainly discovered these patterns during fieldwork and is retrofitting a deductive frame.
- Why it matters: Reviewers at ASQ/Organization Science will see this immediately. It undermines credibility — the reader suspects the "predictions" were actually discoveries. Worse, it misrepresents the epistemic process, which is a form of intellectual dishonesty.
- Better abstract (example): "Through 18 months of ethnographic fieldwork across three hospitals, I discovered that AI adoption systematically reduced opportunities for worker skill development — but in ways that varied by task complexity. I draw on organizational learning theory to make sense of these patterns, arguing that AI tools create what I call 'competence traps' that differ qualitatively between routine and complex work."

### Question 12
Explain the concept of "temporal logic" in academic papers. Give one example of good temporal logic and one example of bad temporal logic for a paper based on inductive qualitative research.

**Model answer should include**:
- Temporal logic: The paper should read as if the researcher learned things in the order they actually learned them. The narrative structure should match the epistemic process.
- Good example: "I entered the field expecting to observe how new technology affected surgical teamwork. Instead, I was struck by the informal learning practices that emerged outside sanctioned training. Only after recognizing this pattern across multiple sites did I turn to the literature on situated learning, which provided a framework for understanding why these practices developed."
- Bad example: "Based on situated learning theory, I predicted that informal learning would emerge when formal training was restricted. I conducted ethnographic fieldwork to test this prediction and found evidence supporting my theoretical expectations."
- Why the bad example is bad: It presents an inductive discovery as if it were a deductive test. The researcher didn't predict the finding — they discovered it. Framing discovery as prediction is HARKing (Hypothesizing After Results are Known).
