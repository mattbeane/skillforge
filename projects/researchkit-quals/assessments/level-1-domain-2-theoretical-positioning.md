## Section A: Multiple Choice (10 questions)

### Question 1
A researcher finds that hospital workers adopt new technology faster than expected. They write: "Prior research has not examined technology adoption in hospitals." What's wrong with this framing?

- a) Nothing — identifying a gap is good research practice
- b) It's a "gap in the literature" framing when it should be a "puzzle in the world" — the interesting thing is that adoption is FASTER than theory predicts, not that nobody studied hospitals
- c) They should cite more prior research
- d) The finding isn't interesting enough

**Correct**: b
**Why**: "Nobody studied X in context Y" isn't compelling. "Theory predicts slow adoption but we see fast adoption — why?" is a puzzle that demands explanation. The gap should be theoretical, not bibliographic.

### Question 2
A researcher discovers that some surgical trainees learn robotic skills in half the expected time. Which theoretical positioning is strongest?

- a) "We contribute to the literature on surgical education"
- b) "We examine factors affecting surgical training outcomes"
- c) "Deliberate practice theory predicts skill requires repetition, but these trainees achieved mastery without it — suggesting an alternative learning mechanism"
- d) "Our findings are relevant to theories of human capital development"

**Correct**: c
**Why**: It names a specific theory (deliberate practice), states its prediction, and shows the finding violates that prediction. The others are vague or decorative.

### Question 3
Zuckerman distinguishes "row" and "column" audiences. Match each framing to its audience type:

| Framing | Audience |
|---------|----------|
| "This extends routine dynamics theory by showing how routines break down during technology transitions" | ? |
| "This helps us understand why surgical training produces uneven outcomes across hospitals" | ? |

- a) First is row, second is column
- b) First is column, second is row
- c) Both are column
- d) Both are row

**Correct**: b
**Why**: The first framing is about the theory (routine dynamics — a column). The second is about the phenomenon (surgical training — a row). Column audiences care about extending theory; row audiences care about understanding the phenomenon.

---

### Question 4
A researcher finds that incentive pay increases effort for managers but decreases it for frontline workers. What should they do?

- a) Report the average effect across both groups
- b) Focus on whichever group shows the stronger effect
- c) Search for a sensitizing literature that explains WHY the two groups respond differently
- d) Conclude that incentive pay has mixed effects

**Correct**: c
**Why**: The heterogeneity IS the story. A sensitizing literature (e.g., self-determination theory, status threat) could explain who responds positively and why — and that bridge becomes the contribution.

---

### Question 5
Which of these is a well-articulated contribution statement?

- a) "We contribute to the literature on organizational learning by examining automation"
- b) "We explore how technology shapes work practices in hospital settings"
- c) "We show that organizational learning degrades under automation — but only when workers lack task autonomy — extending situated learning theory to human-machine contexts"
- d) "This paper investigates the relationship between technology and skill development"

**Correct**: c
**Why**: It states a specific finding, names a boundary condition, and identifies the theory being extended. The others use empty verbs ("examine," "explore," "investigate") that say nothing about what was actually found.

---

### Question 6
What is the function of a "sensitizing literature" in theoretical positioning?

- a) It shows you've read widely in related fields
- b) It explains WHY your finding varies across contexts — bridging the violated theory and your finding
- c) It provides additional citations for the literature review
- d) It replaces the primary theory when the primary theory is wrong

**Correct**: b
**Why**: The sensitizing literature explains heterogeneity. Your primary theory makes a prediction that your finding violates — the sensitizing literature explains when and why the violation occurs. The bridge IS the contribution.

---

### Question 7
A researcher cites two bodies of literature — organizational learning and technology adoption — in their theory section. They present each literature separately and then move to methods. What's missing?

- a) Nothing — two literature reviews is thorough
- b) A third literature to triangulate
- c) The bridge — they need to explain how these literatures connect to each other and why their intersection creates a gap
- d) A hypothesis section after the literature review

**Correct**: c
**Why**: Citing two literatures side by side without bridging them is decoration, not positioning. The researcher needs to show how the intersection of these literatures creates a specific puzzle or gap that their finding addresses.

---

### Question 8
A researcher studies how nurses develop informal workarounds when electronic health records slow them down. They frame it as: "We examine workarounds in healthcare." A colleague suggests reframing as: "Institutional theory predicts compliance with mandated systems, but nurses systematically deviate — producing a shadow workflow that outperforms the official process." Which framing is better and why?

- a) The first — it's more accessible to a general audience
- b) The second — it names a theory, states its prediction, and shows a specific violation that demands explanation
- c) Neither — both need more hedging
- d) The first — the second is too narrow

**Correct**: b
**Why**: The second framing creates a puzzle: why would non-compliance produce better outcomes? It names institutional theory, sets up a specific tension, and makes the reader want to know the answer.

---

### Question 9
A paper claims three contributions: (1) "We extend learning theory," (2) "We show learning occurs in new settings," (3) "We demonstrate learning is important in hospitals." What's wrong?

- a) Nothing — more contributions are better
- b) These are actually one contribution stated three ways — extending learning theory, studying learning in new settings, and claiming learning matters are not three distinct contributions
- c) They need a fourth contribution
- d) The contributions should be in a different order

**Correct**: b
**Why**: Listing variations of the same idea as separate contributions inflates without adding substance. A genuine three-contribution paper would have three truly distinct theoretical claims.

---

### Question 10
When should you choose a "row" (phenomenon) audience over a "column" (theory) audience?

- a) When you haven't read enough theory
- b) When the phenomenon is the contribution — something previously undocumented or misunderstood — and your finding is better explained by describing the phenomenon than by extending any single theory
- c) When you want a broader readership
- d) When the theory literature is too competitive

**Correct**: b
**Why**: Row papers contribute by illuminating a phenomenon. If the phenomenon itself is surprising, novel, or systematically misunderstood, a phenomenon-centered framing can be more powerful than forcing a theoretical extension.

## Section B: Short Answer (2 questions)

### Question 11
A researcher finds that experienced surgeons who use older robots outperform surgeons using newer robots on certain procedures. Explain how you would theoretically position this finding. Include: (1) which theory or assumption it might violate, (2) whether you'd target a row or column audience, and (3) what kind of sensitizing literature might explain the heterogeneity.

**Model answer should include**:
- Theory violated: Technology adoption theory, or "newer is better" assumptions about equipment — the expectation is that newer technology produces better outcomes
- Row vs column: Could go either way. Column: extend technology management theory (not all upgrades improve performance). Row: explain the surgical training phenomenon (why experience with degrading tools outperforms newness)
- Sensitizing literature could include: expertise/deep practice theory (experienced surgeons have embodied knowledge of older machines), organizational routine theory (routines built around old technology transfer poorly to new), or human-machine interaction (skilled users co-evolve with specific tools)
- The bridge: technology management assumes newer = better, but expertise theory suggests deep familiarity with specific tools creates performance advantages that new equipment disrupts

### Question 12
Evaluate this contribution statement: "This paper contributes to the growing body of literature on AI in organizations by exploring how artificial intelligence reshapes knowledge work in professional service firms."

Identify at least TWO problems and write a better version.

**Model answer should include any 2 of**:
- Uses empty verb "exploring" — says nothing about what was found
- "Contributing to the growing body of literature" is a placeholder, not a contribution — it says the topic is popular, not what the paper adds
- "Reshapes knowledge work" is vague — how? In what direction? With what mechanism?
- "Professional service firms" may be the context but isn't the contribution itself — context alone ≠ contribution
- Better version (example): "We show that AI tools fragment professional judgment — accelerating routine analysis while degrading the tacit reasoning it depends on — challenging assumptions that AI augments rather than displaces expert cognition"
