## Section A: Multiple Choice (10 questions)

### Question 1
A researcher quotes 8 informants who describe using informal workarounds. Their dataset has 47 interviews. What should they report about the other 39?

- a) Nothing — 8 quotes is plenty
- b) "The remaining interviews did not address this topic"
- c) Whether any of the other 39 describe experiences that CONTRADICT the workaround story — and document what they found either way
- d) A summary table showing all 47 interviews support the finding

**Correct**: c
**Why**: Silence about the rest of the data is a form of cherry-picking. The researcher must explicitly search for and report disconfirming evidence. Even "I searched the remaining 39 interviews and found 3 that describe the opposite experience" is valuable — it shows honest auditing.

---

### Question 2
A paper reports: "All informants confirmed the proposed mechanism." What should you conclude?

- a) The mechanism is very robust
- b) The researcher probably didn't look hard enough for disconfirming evidence — zero contradictions in qualitative data is implausible if the search was genuine
- c) The sample was well-chosen
- d) The mechanism is proven

**Correct**: b
**Why**: Real qualitative data is messy. Honest coding almost always finds exceptions, complications, or boundary cases. Zero disconfirming evidence is a red flag for cherry-picking, not a sign of robustness.

---

### Question 3
You find that your proposed mechanism has strong support from managers (10 of 12) but weak support from frontline workers (4 of 15). What's the right response?

- a) Report only the manager data — they have better perspective
- b) Report the aggregate (14/27 = 52%) without breaking it out
- c) Report the role-based distribution and investigate what it means — managers and workers may experience the mechanism differently, which is a boundary condition
- d) Interview more workers until the numbers improve

**Correct**: c
**Why**: The distribution IS data. If your mechanism operates differently for managers vs. workers, that's a boundary condition worth documenting. Hiding the distribution behind an aggregate obscures potentially important heterogeneity.

---

### Question 4
What does "adversarial evidence search" mean?

- a) Finding evidence to attack other researchers' claims
- b) Deliberately searching your OWN data for evidence that would CHALLENGE your claims — the opposite of looking for support
- c) Having adversaries review your paper
- d) Using combative language in the paper

**Correct**: b
**Why**: Adversarial search means actively trying to falsify your own claims. Before each claim, define what evidence would challenge it, then search ALL your data for that evidence. This is the opposite of the natural tendency to look for confirmation.

---

### Question 5
A researcher discovers that 2 of their informants describe experiences directly contradicting their main claim. These 2 informants are both from the same hospital. What's the most productive interpretation?

- a) They're outliers — exclude them
- b) The mechanism doesn't work at that hospital — investigate why. Something about that site may suppress the mechanism, revealing a boundary condition
- c) They were probably poor informants
- d) Two out of many isn't significant

**Correct**: b
**Why**: Clustered exceptions aren't random noise — they signal something systematic. Understanding WHY the mechanism doesn't operate at one site could reveal important scope conditions (organizational culture, leadership, technology vintage, etc.).

---

### Question 6
Before auditing your evidence, you should:

- a) Re-read your best quotes to remind yourself of the story
- b) For each claim, define in advance what evidence would CHALLENGE it — then search the data for that specific evidence
- c) Ask a colleague to review your quotes
- d) Run a statistical test on the qualitative data

**Correct**: b
**Why**: Pre-specifying disconfirmation criteria prevents motivated reasoning during the search. If you know in advance what contradicting evidence looks like, you're more likely to recognize it when you encounter it.

---

### Question 7
What is "evidence distribution analysis" and why does it matter?

- a) It's a statistical technique for weighing evidence
- b) It means tracking WHERE your supporting and challenging evidence comes from — by informant role, site, time period — because concentrated evidence may indicate bias rather than robustness
- c) It means distributing your evidence evenly across sections of the paper
- d) It means sampling from a diverse population

**Correct**: b
**Why**: If all your support comes from managers and all your challenges come from workers, you don't have a robust finding — you have a perspective bias. Distribution analysis reveals whether your evidence base is broad or dangerously concentrated.

---

### Question 8
A researcher writes: "While a few informants expressed different views, the overwhelming majority supported our interpretation." What's wrong with this approach?

- a) Nothing — they acknowledged the exceptions
- b) "A few" is vague (how many?), and "expressed different views" doesn't engage with what those views actually were. The researcher should name the number, describe the specific contradictions, and analyze why those informants differ
- c) They should have removed those informants
- d) The language is too casual

**Correct**: b
**Why**: Vague acknowledgment is almost worse than silence — it signals the researcher knows about contradictions but chose not to engage with them. Honest handling means specific numbers, specific contradicting claims, and analysis of why those informants differ.

---

### Question 9
What is an "alternative interpretation" and how should you handle it?

- a) It's a completely different theory — you should ignore alternatives that don't fit your data
- b) It's another story the same data could tell — you should name the strongest alternatives, explain why your interpretation is more compelling, and acknowledge where the data is genuinely ambiguous
- c) It's what reviewers might say — you should preemptively argue against it
- d) It's a secondary finding — report it in a separate section

**Correct**: b
**Why**: Data is always interpretively ambiguous to some degree. Naming the strongest alternative interpretation and explaining why you prefer yours (while acknowledging uncertainty) is intellectual honesty. Ignoring alternatives invites reviewers to raise them for you — less charitably.

---

### Question 10
You're auditing a paper's claims against the raw data. Which approach is correct?

- a) Read the claims, then search the data for quotes that support each one
- b) Start with the already-cited evidence and verify the claims make sense
- c) For each claim, search ALL data sources — including sources NOT cited — specifically looking for evidence that would CHALLENGE the claim, then document both support and challenges
- d) Spot-check a few claims against the data

**Correct**: c
**Why**: A real audit is adversarial. You search ALL data (not just cited sources) for CHALLENGING evidence (not just support). The goal is to find everything that might weaken the claims — because reviewers will.

## Section B: Short Answer (2 questions)

### Question 11
A paper claims: "Workers in automated facilities develop informal learning strategies to compensate for reduced hands-on training." The dataset includes 47 interviews across 5 hospitals. The paper quotes 8 workers from 2 hospitals. Design an adversarial audit of this claim. Specifically: (1) what would you search for, (2) where would you search, and (3) what would concern you about the evidence distribution?

**Model answer should include**:
- What to search for: Workers who describe having ADEQUATE training in automated facilities (contradicts the "reduced training" premise). Workers who tried informal strategies and FAILED. Workers who succeeded WITHOUT informal strategies. Managers who say training IS adequate.
- Where to search: ALL 47 interviews — not just the 8 already quoted. Specifically target the 3 hospitals NOT quoted. Look at workers across different roles and experience levels. Check whether quantitative training data exists that might contradict the qualitative story.
- Evidence distribution concerns: Only 2 of 5 hospitals represented in quotes — what happens at the other 3? Only workers quoted — what do trainers/managers say? 8 of 47 interviews is a small fraction — why those 8? Are they the most vivid, or the most representative?

---

### Question 12
Explain why documenting disconfirming evidence makes a paper STRONGER rather than weaker. Use a specific example.

**Model answer should include**:
- Counter-intuitive truth: Papers that document disconfirming evidence are more credible than papers with "100% support." Reviewers trust researchers who show honest engagement with complications.
- Example: "If I claim that informal learning compensates for reduced training, and I document that 3 of my 15 frontline workers describe situations where informal learning DIDN'T work — and then I analyze why (they were at sites without experienced mentors to model from) — I've done two things: (1) shown I searched honestly, and (2) identified a boundary condition (the mechanism requires access to experienced peers) that makes the theory MORE precise, not weaker."
- Contrast: "If I report zero exceptions, reviewers suspect I wasn't looking. If I report exceptions and explain them, reviewers see rigor."
- Bottom line: Disconfirming evidence, handled well, becomes a feature of the contribution (boundary conditions, scope conditions, moderators) rather than a threat to it.
