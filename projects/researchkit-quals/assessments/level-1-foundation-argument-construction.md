## Section A: Multiple Choice (10 questions)

### Question 1
Which paragraph opening is strongest for a theory section paragraph?

- a) "Barley (1990) argued that technology shapes organizational structure."
- b) "Technology and organizational structure have a complex, mutually constitutive relationship."
- c) "In this section, we review the literature on technology and organizations."
- d) "Several scholars have studied how technology affects work."

**Correct**: b
**Why**: It's a claim — a contestable statement that the rest of the paragraph will support. Option (a) is citation-first (the citation leads, the claim follows). Option (c) narrates what the section does (not a claim). Option (d) is vague and attribute-free.

### Question 2
Identify the citation function in each sentence:

| Sentence | Function |
|----------|----------|
| "Organizations must adopt new technologies to remain competitive (Henderson & Clark, 1990; Tushman & Anderson, 1986; Abernathy & Clark, 1985)." | ? |
| "Thompson (1967) distinguishes three forms of interdependence, each with different coordination requirements." | ? |
| "Prior research on technology and organizing does not provide much insight into how organizations manage this problem." | ? |

- a) All three are consensus-building
- b) Consensus-building, author-in-prose engagement (steelman), showing absence (gap)
- c) Supporting, explaining, criticizing
- d) Background, analysis, transition

**Correct**: b
**Why**: The first stacks 3 parenthetical citations to establish consensus ("many scholars agree"). The second engages Thompson's framework substantively in prose to build up the position that will be complicated. The third asserts a gap — notably UNCITED, because the absence itself is the author's claim.

---

### Question 3
What is "The Turn" in an academic paper's introduction?

- a) The point where the paper shifts from literature review to methods
- b) A single adversative conjunction ("However," "But," "Nonetheless") that pivots the argument from "what we know" (consensus) to "what we don't know" (gap) — usually followed by a short, sharp sentence
- c) The thesis statement
- d) The transition between introduction and theory section

**Correct**: b
**Why**: The Turn is the rhetorical pivot from consensus to complication. It's typically one word — "However," "But," "Yet" — followed by the gap statement. Its power comes from the contrast: a long consensus-building passage followed by a sharp pivot creates emphasis.

### Question 4
What is wrong with this paragraph transition?

> Paragraph 1 ends: "...surveillance scholars have documented a quantitative increase in monitoring over the past several decades."
>
> Paragraph 2 begins: "Organizations face accountability pressures from many stakeholders simultaneously."

- a) Nothing — both paragraphs are about organizations
- b) There's no conceptual link — paragraph 1's key concept (surveillance increase) is abandoned, and paragraph 2 introduces a new concept (accountability pressures) without connecting to the previous one
- c) The transition word is missing
- d) Paragraph 2 should cite more sources

**Correct**: b
**Why**: Strong transitions thread a concept from one paragraph's end into the next paragraph's beginning. Here, "surveillance increase" → "accountability pressures" is a topic jump. Better: P1 ends with "...increasing monitoring." → P2 begins "This escalation in monitoring creates new accountability challenges..."

---

### Question 5
What is the correct arc of an introduction in a top management journal?

- a) Literature Review → Methods → Findings → Contribution
- b) WORLD → PROBLEM → GAP → QUESTION → PREVIEW
- c) Theory → Hypothesis → Data → Results
- d) Context → Research Question → Summary of Approach

**Correct**: b
**Why**: The introduction builds from a broad phenomenon (WORLD), deepens the problem (PROBLEM), shows what's missing in current understanding (GAP), states the specific question (QUESTION), and previews the study (PREVIEW). This sequence is invariant across ASQ, Organization Science, ASR, and AMJ.

---

### Question 6
A discussion section closes with: "In this paper, we examined how organizations manage technological transitions. We found that resource allocation plays a key role. These findings contribute to the literature on technology management." What's wrong?

- a) Nothing — it summarizes the paper clearly
- b) This is a summary closing — it recapitulates what was done rather than zooming out or restating the paper's core paradox. The final sentence uses the empty phrase "contribute to the literature" without saying what it changes
- c) It needs more citations
- d) It should be longer

**Correct**: b
**Why**: Discussion closings should NEVER summarize. They should either zoom out (connect to a larger question or future trajectory) or restate the paper's core paradox in memorable language. "We examined... We found... These contribute..." is the most common closing failure.

---

### Question 7
How should citations shift across the sections of a paper?

- a) More citations in the introduction, fewer in the discussion
- b) Introductions use mostly parenthetical stacks (consensus). Theory sections mix parenthetical and author-in-prose (building and complicating). Discussions use fewer, more targeted citations anchored to specific literatures being extended
- c) All sections should use citations the same way
- d) Discussions should have the most citations to show comprehensive knowledge

**Correct**: b
**Why**: Citation function shifts with the argumentative purpose of each section. Early: establish consensus (stacks). Middle: engage specific works substantively (prose). Late: anchor contributions to specific literatures (targeted). Using the same pattern everywhere flattens the argument.

---

### Question 8
A paragraph in a theory section has five sentences. Sentence 1 is: "Leonardi (2011) studied how engineers evaluated new technology." What should the writer change?

- a) Nothing — citing Leonardi first establishes authority
- b) The paragraph should open with a CLAIM, not a citation. Better: "Engineers assess technology by evaluating how it enables or constrains their next project (Leonardi, 2011)." — the claim leads, the citation supports
- c) They should cite more authors in the first sentence
- d) The sentence is too short

**Correct**: b
**Why**: Citation-first paragraphs are a structural weakness. The paragraph should open with a contestable claim that the rest of the paragraph supports. Citations appear as evidence FOR the claim, not as the subject of the sentence.

---

### Question 9
What is the "consensus-then-complicate" move in a theory section?

- a) Agree with all prior research, then add your contribution
- b) Build a genuine steelman of the dominant position using consensus citations, then pivot with an adversative conjunction to show what the consensus misses — the consensus should be the STRONGEST case for the position you're about to challenge
- c) Review the literature comprehensively, then note a gap
- d) Cite scholars who agree with you, then cite scholars who disagree

**Correct**: b
**Why**: The steelman is critical — if you build a weak version of the consensus, your gap claim is unimpressive. You must make the reader believe the consensus before complicating it. The stronger your steelman, the more powerful the pivot.

---

### Question 10
Which of these is a properly crafted gap statement?

- a) "More research is needed on technology and work."
- b) "Despite extensive research on how technology changes task structure, we lack an account of the process by which organizations distribute expertise across old and new technological platforms — particularly when both must operate simultaneously."
- c) "No one has studied this topic in hospitals."
- d) "The literature has a gap."

**Correct**: b
**Why**: It names what HAS been studied (technology → task structure), specifies what's MISSING (the process of distributing expertise across platforms), and adds a scope condition (simultaneous operation). Options (a), (c), and (d) are vague — they don't specify what mechanism or process is absent.

## Section B: Short Answer (2 questions)

### Question 11
Here are two consecutive paragraphs from a theory section. Diagnose the transition problem and rewrite the opening of the second paragraph to fix it.

> **Paragraph 1**: "...As organizations accumulate both legacy and cutting-edge systems, they face what we call the 'technological portfolio problem' — the challenge of maintaining competence across generations of technology that require fundamentally different skills."
>
> **Paragraph 2**: "Scholars of professional work have long studied how occupations maintain jurisdiction over their domains of expertise (Abbott, 1988; Bechky, 2003)."

**Model answer should include**:
- Problem: Topic jump. Paragraph 1 ends with "technological portfolio problem" and fundamentally different skills. Paragraph 2 opens with a new topic (professional jurisdiction) with no connection to the portfolio problem.
- The fix should thread "portfolio problem" or "different skills" into the opening of paragraph 2.
- Example rewrite: "This technological portfolio problem is fundamentally a problem of professional competence — maintaining expertise across systems that demand different skills. Scholars of professional work have long studied how occupations maintain jurisdiction over their domains of expertise (Abbott, 1988; Bechky, 2003), but this literature has largely assumed a stable technological base."
- The rewrite threads "portfolio problem" → "professional competence" → professional work literature, creating a conceptual bridge rather than a topic jump.

### Question 12
Read this discussion contribution paragraph and identify what's wrong with it structurally. Then describe how it should be restructured using the four-move pattern (literature anchor → contrast/extension → mechanism description → implication).

> "We found that workers develop informal learning strategies when formal training is restricted by automation. This is an important finding because it shows that learning can happen outside formal channels. Prior research on situated learning has shown that learning is embedded in practice (Lave & Wenger, 1991). Our finding extends this work."

**Model answer should include**:
- Problems: The paragraph leads with the FINDING ("We found that...") rather than anchoring to the LITERATURE. "This is an important finding" asserts importance without demonstrating it. The literature comes AFTER the finding instead of framing it. "Extends this work" is empty — doesn't say how.
- Correct structure using four-move pattern:
  1. **Literature anchor**: Start with the existing understanding — "Situated learning theory holds that skill development is inseparable from the practices in which it is embedded (Lave & Wenger, 1991)."
  2. **Contrast/extension**: Show how the finding changes that understanding — "Our findings reveal that when automation restricts legitimate peripheral participation, workers construct alternative practice contexts — informal, unauthorized, and often invisible to supervisors."
  3. **Mechanism description**: Name the mechanism — "This 'shadow learning' operates through..."
  4. **Implication**: State what changes — "This extends situated learning theory to contexts where the community of practice itself has been disrupted by technology — suggesting that practitioners will reconstruct the conditions for learning even when organizations don't provide them."
