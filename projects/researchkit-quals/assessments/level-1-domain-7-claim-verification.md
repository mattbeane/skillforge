## Section A: Multiple Choice (10 questions)

### Question 1
A researcher writes: "Robotic surgery causes skill degradation in trainees." Their evidence is a cross-sectional correlation between robot exposure and skill assessments. What's wrong with this claim?

- a) Nothing—the correlation is evidence of causation
- b) This is a causal overclaim—they can only say "exposure is associated with lower skills," not that it causes degradation
- c) They need a larger sample size
- d) Skill degradation is too strong a term

**Correct**: b
**Why**: Cross-sectional data can't establish causation. Lower-skilled trainees might be assigned to robots, or a third factor might explain both. The claim should be "associated with," not "causes."

---

### Question 2
Match the claim to the appropriate evidence level:

| Claim | Appropriate? |
|-------|--------------|
| "The evidence establishes that shadow learning is necessary for skill acquisition" | ? |

The researcher has: Qualitative interviews where successful learners describe shadow learning practices, but no data on whether shadow learning is SUFFICIENT or whether other paths work.

- a) Appropriate—the interviews establish the claim
- b) Overclaim—evidence shows shadow learning is ONE path, not that it's necessary
- c) Underclaim—the evidence is stronger than stated
- d) The claim needs more hedging words

**Correct**: b
**Why**: "Necessary" means no other path works. The evidence shows shadow learning worked for THESE learners, not that it's the only path. Should say "was associated with" or "appeared to enable."

---

### Question 3
A researcher finds that experienced staff develop workarounds for degrading technology. They write: "Workers want the organization to fix the technology." What type of overclaim is this?

- a) Causal overclaim
- b) Scope overclaim
- c) Measurement overclaim—they observed behavior, not preferences
- d) Mechanism overclaim

**Correct**: c
**Why**: The researcher observed workaround behavior. They didn't measure what workers "want." Revealed preferences (behavior) ≠ stated preferences. Workers might prefer the workarounds, or accept the situation, or many other things.

---

### Question 4
Which of these phrases is a red flag for overclaiming?

- a) "The pattern is consistent with..."
- b) "The evidence suggests..."
- c) "This proves that..."
- d) "We observed that..."

**Correct**: c
**Why**: "Proves" is almost never appropriate in social science. Even strong experimental evidence doesn't "prove"—it supports, suggests, or demonstrates. "Proves" claims certainty that isn't warranted.

---

### Question 5
A researcher studied surgical learning at 5 hospitals. They write: "Surgical training is broken nationwide—trainees everywhere face these barriers." What type of overclaim is this?

- a) Causal overclaim
- b) Scope overclaim—generalizing from 5 hospitals to "nationwide"
- c) Mechanism overclaim
- d) Measurement overclaim

**Correct**: b
**Why**: Five hospitals (even if carefully selected) can't support claims about "everywhere" or "nationwide." Should say "at the hospitals we studied" or "in similar contexts."

---

### Question 6
A researcher finds that residents who engage in shadow learning score higher on skill assessments. They claim: "Shadow learning improves surgical skill." What question should you ask first?

- a) Was the sample large enough?
- b) Could there be selection—do already-skilled residents engage more in shadow learning, rather than shadow learning making them skilled?
- c) Were the assessments reliable?
- d) Did the researcher have IRB approval?

**Correct**: b
**Why**: This is a classic reverse causality problem. More talented/motivated residents might both (a) seek out shadow learning AND (b) score higher—with no causal connection between the two. Claiming causation requires ruling out selection.

---

### Question 7
A verification package should include:

- a) Only the evidence supporting each claim
- b) Each substantive claim, supporting evidence, AND challenging evidence
- c) Raw data files for others to analyze
- d) A summary of the main findings

**Correct**: b
**Why**: Verification requires seeing BOTH supporting and challenging evidence. A package with only supporting evidence doesn't allow genuine verification—it's just advocacy.

---

### Question 8
A reviewer asks a researcher to strengthen their claims. The researcher's evidence is moderate at best. What should they do?

- a) Strengthen the claims as requested—reviewers know best
- b) Maintain claim-evidence calibration even if it means rejecting the reviewer's request
- c) Add more hedging words to the stronger claims
- d) Find additional supporting evidence to justify stronger claims

**Correct**: b
**Why**: Integrity means matching claim strength to evidence strength, even under pressure. Reviewers sometimes push for overclaiming; the researcher's job is to resist this while addressing legitimate concerns.

---

### Question 9
A researcher studied how trainees learn in the shadows. They write: "Our informants learned through unofficial channels." Their evidence is informants' retrospective accounts of their training. What should they acknowledge?

- a) Retrospective accounts may be subject to recall bias and post-hoc rationalization
- b) Nothing—informants know their own experience
- c) They need more informants
- d) The quotes weren't vivid enough

**Correct**: a
**Why**: Retrospective accounts are vulnerable to biases—people reconstruct their past to fit current narratives. Successful surgeons might attribute their success to shadow learning even if other factors mattered more. This limitation should be acknowledged.

---

### Question 10
A paper draft claims: "Technology reconfigures work in ways that eliminate trainee participation." The evidence shows THIS HAPPENED in robotic surgery at the studied hospitals. What's the problem?

- a) Nothing—the claim is supported
- b) This is a general claim about "technology" when the evidence is specific to robotic surgery in particular contexts
- c) The claim needs more hedging
- d) More hospitals should be studied

**Correct**: b
**Why**: The evidence is about robotic surgery specifically. Claiming that "technology" in general reconfigures work this way is an overgeneralization. Should specify "robotic surgical systems" or "technologies that concentrate control in expert hands."

---

## Section B: Short Answer (2 questions)

### Question 11
A researcher writes: "Shadow learning is the primary mechanism by which trainees acquire robotic surgical skill when legitimate participation fails."

Identify at least TWO potential overclaims in this sentence and suggest how to revise each.

**Model answer should include any 2 of**:
- "Primary mechanism" → Evidence shows it's ONE mechanism that worked for successful learners; may not be the only or primary one. Revise to: "a key mechanism" or "an important path"
- "Trainees acquire" → Only studied successful learners; didn't show all trainees acquire skill this way. Revise to: "some trainees appeared to acquire"
- Implicit causality → Evidence shows association, not that shadow learning causes skill. Revise to: "is associated with" or "appears to enable"
- "When legitimate participation fails" → Assumes legitimate participation always fails in robotic surgery; may be context-dependent. Revise to: "when legitimate participation is limited"

---

### Question 12
You're reviewing a colleague's paper. They report finding a mechanism through qualitative coding but include NO disconfirming evidence. They say: "All our informants confirmed the mechanism."

Write 2-3 sentences explaining why this is problematic and what you would recommend.

**Model answer should include**:
- Zero disconfirming evidence is implausible—real data is messy, and honest coding almost always finds exceptions or complications
- This suggests the researcher may not have genuinely looked for disconfirming evidence, or may have interpreted ambiguous quotes as confirmatory
- Recommendation: Go back through the data specifically looking for quotes/cases that challenge the mechanism; report how they reconciled any exceptions; include at least one disconfirming quote in the paper
- Without disconfirming evidence, reviewers and readers cannot trust that the researcher engaged in genuine analysis vs. selective reading
