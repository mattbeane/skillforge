He welcomed me in. Civil war buff, knew chamberlain from Bowdoin.</span></p><p id="7"><span id="8">He feels what he’s doing – the organ is produced through the hands, not just the eyes. There’s SO much touching! </span></p><p id="9"><span id="10">A lot more blood, spread all over the surgeons, the patient.</span></p><p id="11"><span id="12">Great conversation with scrub Mark and circ:</span></p><p id="13"><span id="14">He’s supervising a student, who is doing so good he doesn’t need to do anything</span></p><p id="15"><span id="16">Whole conversation about private scrubs and intact teams – helps hospital to break that up (fills white space), better patient care (vehement) with intact teams and private scrubs</span></p><p id="17"><span id="18">	When you get good, they’re on step A, and you’re ready for step C. They don’t have to ask. </span></p><p id="19"><span id="20">Now certification required, pay self</span></p><p id="21"><span id="22">J: Is that continent? Is that continent (pushes bladder, sprays urine). On the table. (showing student)</span></p><p id="23"><span id="24">Holds up prostate – “do it” “one shot” cut off. </span></p><p id="25"><span id="26">** Suturing bladder opening – MICRO work compared to robot!! Without the magnification, it’s finer than needlepoint.</span></p><p id="27"><span id="28">J: There’s your bladder neck. Can’t get a better bladder neck than that.</span></p><p id="29"><span id="30">J (to med student): Ever see a bladder neck in a robotic procedure like that? </span></p><p id="31"><span id="32">R: no</span></p><p id="33"><span id="34">J: I have an advantage. They’re [robotic surgeons] coming in from above, I’m coming in from below, so I can see what I’m doing. </span></p><p id="35"><span id="36">J: Hear that chatter? (to resident, referring to a squeaky noise that sutures make when the chief was cinching the sutures shut) That means there’s juice on the sutures. Not supposed to hear that chatter. **</span></p><p id="37"><span id="38">Guitar string foley trick (he invented it) – gives vibration sensation to the person tying the knots to cinch bladder up to urethra as to whether they’re on track or not</span></p><p id="39"><span id="40">Asking about occupation of patient. </span></p><p id="41"><span id="42">Chief resident doing most of the fine work, J holding back and supporting. This was true throughout the operation – in fact, J was mostly sucking. Interesting.</span></p><p id="43"><span id="44">Then he leaves, once retractors are back. Chief instructing medical student on the sutures. </span></p><p id="45"><span id="46">C scrubs in, funny seeing her here. </span></p><p id="47"><span id="48">Instruction to student from Chief on how to position his body, how to stand – he said “suturing is as much about how you stand relative to the body as it is about…”</span></p><p id="49"><span id="50">Closing up here takes a LOT longer. Slow to suture muscle, viscera, skin all back together. HUGE ** time for socializing, real teaching, less formal, more learning for those lower on the totem pole, without having to perform?</span></p><p id="51"><span id="52">When C came in, student backed out to next layer. Hierarchy = proximity to the action, increasing responsibility (except J here – interesting **)</span></p><p id="53"><span id="54">Lots of chatting, closing only takes one person for most of the time. </span></p><p id="55"><span id="56">Talk about drinking, the yearly party, getting IV fluids to kill hangovers, etc. </span></p><p id="57"><span id="58">Stapling up, done.</span></p></body></html>
