Hell of an experience. I walk into the operating room, guided by a very laissez-faire Canes, he swings open the OR door, and there we are,looking at a man’s belly, cut wide open and held apart by a metal rack with retractors bolted onto it. The AP and the chief surgeon both have their hands down into this hole. They welcome me in, and within a few minutes the circulating nurse gets me a footstool to stand on, six inches behind the chief surgeon, so I can watch over his shoulder. The metal rack is much more Frankenstein than I would have expected. </span></p><p id="5"><span id="6">This is a far more brutal enterprise. Sophisticated, to be sure, but brutal, nonetheless. There is cutting, there is bleeding, there is tissue, hands engage it. The smells are noted, and important (e.g. the coagulant smells like a candy that J used to have as a kid). </span></p><p id="7"><span id="8">He immediately engaged with me in the name game that underlies this entire activity. What are we looking at? How is it different or separable from the rest of the patient? And how can wedowngrade the rest of that patient so it’s background noise, so it’s conceptually less prevalent. </span></p><p id="9"><span id="10">How about the creation of NON focal tissues? ** I.e. the creation of “stuff” as named by Canes today.</span></p><p id="11"><br id="12"/></p></body></html>
