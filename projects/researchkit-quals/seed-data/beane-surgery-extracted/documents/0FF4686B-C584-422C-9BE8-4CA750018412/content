A standing by, hand on mayo</span></p><p id="327"><span id="328">2:52:46 PM</span></p><p id="329"><span id="330">C: so turn the cmear counterclockwise, no, you’re just moving to the left there, counterclockwise, no you’re just moving to the left, move forward, more counterclockwise, good, that’s going to give you the angle you need to get this structure. </span></p><p id="331"><span id="332">C: good, you’re going to go right here</span></p><p id="333"><span id="334">W: []</span></p><p id="335"><span id="336">C: you’re going to go to the diaphragm, so the spelen doesn’t really have too many attachments, but right in here you can get into the splenotic vessels (holding tissue with sucker) your goal is to flip the spleen over, not to detach it, that’s fine, I would use cautery, look down so you can see that, good. A</span></p><p id="337"><span id="338">C: so you reaclly should be in here like that</span></p><p id="339"><span id="340">W: yeah&lt; isee what you’re saying.

So straighten your camera out a little, take this tissue down there (retracting tissue with sucker). Now look down to your left so you can center wher eyou’re working, left hand into that space, nope, into where my hand, is exactly, that’s what I like to see, you’re developing that plane, the attachments to that spleen are taking plane, so I don’t like how you used your tip of your scissor, I don’t want that to be going into the splkeen</span></p><p id="349"><span id="350">W: oh, the tip of the bipolar</span></p><p id="351"><span id="352">C: no, the tip of the scissor, the bipolar would be fine, bbecause it’s fenestrated</span></p><p id="353"><span id="354">2:57:17 PM</span></p><p id="355"><span id="356">Come in here, the nice</span></p><p id="357"><span id="358">2:57:25 PM</span></p><p id="359"><span id="360">A standing by</span></p><p id="361"><span id="362">C: cauterize that, I think that’s a little high, I think its down here. </span></p><p id="363"><span id="364">2:57:44 PM</span></p><p id="365"><span id="366">C: so at this point, your left hand should push up here (shakes where he put his sucker).

So that’s her ureter, so go below that</span></p><p id="367"><span id="368">W: clipping down right here, thin it out</span></p><p id="369"><span id="370">C: but you need to get below here where my sucker is, and so for practice purposed, just don’t grab the ureter, even though it makes no difference in this case</span></p><p id="371"><span id="372">C: cauterize this please?</span></p><p id="373"><span id="374">2:58:58 PM</span></p><p id="375"><span id="376">S: do you have extra gloves, A? For them?</span></p><p id="377"><span id="378">A shows them</span></p><p id="379"><span id="380">C: so the soaz go, get your space, move your acamera so you can see, good.

So with your left hand lift up. Yep, sweep it up, use this like a hook, I want you to open your jaws, exactly, get your jaws under there and then cautery. So the fat will sweep, the shiny stuff will. Remember this is a case that should honstely take 25 minutes ,so there are a lot of ways of making this shorter or longer. </span></p><p id="389"><span id="390">C: yep, I like how you turned the camera there, so you cleared this whole thing out, so now you can see what’s the fat concealing, right?</span></p><p id="391"><span id="392">W: yep</span></p><p id="393"><span id="394">C: so you lift up, cauterize with your left hand, switch back and cauterize, you could lift up, or I could even do it better, but go ahead and lift with your right hand</span></p><p id="395"><span id="396">A standing by, S in the corner </span></p><p id="397"><span id="398">C: this is where you lose out to the ligature, it’s so much faster</span></p><p id="399"><span id="400">W: yeah</span></p><p id="401"><span id="402">C: yeah&lt; i would have gone right back up to where you were with the left hand.
