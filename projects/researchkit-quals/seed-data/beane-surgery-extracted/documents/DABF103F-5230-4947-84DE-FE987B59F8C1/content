I don’t see any big difference. What I do see is that the surgeons are a little bit more relaxed. It’s easier for them because they actually get to sit down. This is a procedure where say where if it were open and laparoscopic, their standing for 3, 4, 5 hours depending on what robotic procedure you’re doing. And no one comes in to give the surgeon lunch break. You know, they don’t get any break, they don’t get to sit down. This [the da Vinci] right here, they can if they want to they can move around the room while they’re waiting for the pathologist to come back, or in the old robot and you’re training a resident, you have to get up out of your seat to let the resident sit down and do it, so they [the surgeon] can move around a little bit. I think it’s less of a toll on them physically, they’re not standing, they’re sitting, they’re a little bit more relaxed. So the benefit to the surgeon, there’s many. I don’t think this any different say between the laparoscopic prostatectomy and a robotic prostatectomy, except from the surgeon’s point of view. The instruments articulate better, so it’s not like some surgeons trying to work their wrist and ankle their body so they can get the right angles of the instrument to cut or cauterize or whatever it is they’re doing. It’s easier for the surgeon. The benefits for the surgeon are many. They can see things better, it’s a 3-D image, they can definitely tell the difference between different tissues. So I see it more as something that’s more beneficial to the surgeon then to the patient. </span></p><p id="5"><span id="6">The only thing is if you want to compare open to laparoscopic or open to robotic, well obviously the benefit is obviously that the patient doesn’t have this huge incision, their recovery time is much shorter, and all those kinds of benefits, but those are the same kinds of benefits they’d see with a regular laparoscopic procedure.</span></p></body></html>
