What should happen in these, most facilities don’t tend to replace these, they don’t have spares. So more often times than not - if I put this up to the light [does so], see how these little black marks on them [lenses at the end of each vision cable], so this isn’t terrible, but it’s more damage, and the higher I get to the light, the more black spots you’ll see on this. So if I use the lightbulb I can turn down some of the brightness on it, but even sometimes it’s as simple as just changing this cable, which will hopefully help the brightness or hopefully turn down the brightness, but then there’s the intensity of it. I can manipulate on the brightness, I can manipulate each eye, I can manipulate the right eye or the left eye, or both eyes, but that was on the intensity, but the brightness I can turn down, so actually light intensities like an turndown, the brightness I can manipulate for both eyes one eye or both eyes so I can change the brightness so I can change his right eye brighter to than his left eye or his left eye brighter than right eye, the intensity covers both, it’s either going to lighten or darken his picture whereas the other one I can do both eyes.</span></p></body></html>
