I know it makes him kind of nuts. I don’t understand why the clinic doesn’t get another robot. But money is always at the source for everything. And if it’s really that important, then he shouldn’t do his cases with that robot. But that will never happen, because they have to operate – they’re forced to operate.</span></p><p id="3"><span id="4">The compensatory strategies we use really make the product very consistent, how’s that? Even if I’m pissed off, I try not to let it, or if the surgeon’s pissed off, I compensate for that and I don’t bug him. We all do that, I hope we’re all attuned to each other enough so we just get the job done.  </span></p></body></html>
