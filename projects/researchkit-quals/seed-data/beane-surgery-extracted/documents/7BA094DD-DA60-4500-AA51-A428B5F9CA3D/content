You found the pubic bone, it’s over,</span></p><p id="479"><span id="480">D: yeah do the []</span></p><p id="481"><span id="482">C: the way (sw ­10:30:27 AM) you do that is your hand stays closed, your hand stays down here, and you push circularly ly to the bladder, see this?</span></p><p id="483"><span id="484">D: yeah</span></p><p id="485"><span id="486">C: which develops thepubic arch here</span></p><p id="487"><span id="488">10:30:52 AM</span></p><p id="489"><span id="490">J nodding off, me too</span></p><p id="491"><span id="492">10:31:05 AM</span></p><p id="493"><span id="494">C: we need the pubic arch here, we need the same circular stuff (sw ­10:31:23 AM) on this side, see if you can get </span></p><p id="495"><span id="496">C: you see that cmeara – stop – see that camre on the lower right hands side, shows your horizon. Stop for a second, buzz that artery</span></p><p id="497"><span id="498">C: get out for  a second (d does) you’re pushing too hard down this way, (motioning hand) and then you pull down over this way, okay take your head out, letme show you thenext step (10:32:56 AM) just as a matter of principle, you reach for that, the most</span></p><p id="499"><span id="500">D: yeah yeah, there’s not as much energy applied</span></p><p id="501"><span id="502">C: and there’s more, most robotic surgery it keeps risk low if your risks are in neutral. Usually the most direct approach is the most appropriate. People when they’re learning will go like this (does awkward wrist bend retraction), keep your intstrument neutral, it’s just easier. This guy has adhesions here from hernias, so I’m going to dothsi stuff</span></p><p id="503"><span id="504">D: okay</span></p><p id="505"><span id="506">C/; see it’s just briushing like with a pencil, what this does is then, here’s the pubic arch, here’s the vein, the case ending maneuver, the iliac vein, so what’ive creaed between is obviously safe, and that’s what you want ot strive for is to make everything obvious</span></p><p id="507"><span id="508">D: yeah</span></p><p id="509"><span id="510">C: and if thery’re not obvious to you, don’t keep going, make it obvious to you***</span></p><p id="511"><span id="512">D: right</span></p><p id="513"><span id="514">C: so I’m just brushing on the tissue here (illumination dramatically down because he zooms out)</span></p><p id="515"><span id="516">10:36:21 AM</span></p><p id="517"><span id="518">C: a little tension on this side, </span></p><p id="519"><span id="520">C: this is bladder fat, this wants to come towards me </span></p><p id="521"><span id="522">J: nodding off</span></p><p id="523"><span id="524">10:36:43 AM</span></p><p id="525"><span id="526">C: see, this can be extremely confusing</span></p><p id="527"><span id="528">D: if you’re not expecting it</span></p><p id="529"><span id="530">10:37:12 AM</span></p><p id="531"><span id="532">C: this applies to all surgery, when a beginner sees this for the firs time, if they’re not thinking properly, they’ll bend what they see to fit their own paradigm, and they’ll create an injury, instead of saying “that doesn’t look right”, or asking for help. First time I saw that, it took me about 20 minutes to figure out what it was. What I do is to alert the patient at they have it, and alret them to the fact that they have it. Some people will fix those. There’s literature that says it’s safe to put mesh in during prostate</span></p><p id="533"><span id="534">C: so here’s a prediction that may be wrong, but you see this vein going across? It could be a substitute for a dorsal vein, so we may not have a dorsal vein. </span></p><p id="535"><span id="536">C: look, this is all fat here, there is no vein. I never noticed this in open surgery</span></p><p id="537"><span id="538">D: you odn’t have this view***</span></p><p id="539"><span id="540">10:40:08 AM</span></p><p id="541"><span id="542"> C: sometimes, if you give this the tiniest little zap, the muscle will contract and the space will open</span></p><p id="543"><span id="544">D yeah</span></p><p id="545"><span id="546">10:43:13 AM</span></p><p id="547"><span id="548">C: there’s a great X quote, which I should share now: you only see what you’re looking for, and you only see what you know.

So it’s retract, put the needle over it, then move it all back</span></p><p id="567"><span id="568">C over, walks around the room</span></p><p id="569"><span id="570">10:51:21 AM</span></p><p id="571"><span id="572">R came in and kidded around to J</span></p><p id="573"><span id="574">C: I decided I needed to get some of that brookstone kinetic sand to play with in the or, it would relieve so much frustration***</span></p><p id="575"><span id="576">10:52:15 AM</span></p><p id="577"><span id="578">C: nope. That’s no good, do you see why?</span></p><p id="579"><span id="580">D: yes, it’s not low enough. </span></p><p id="581"><span id="582">C: yes, that’s promising. Now don’t take it out in one move, cause you’ll get the vein. Take it out in a couple of moves with your right. One two ogood good, now zoom out, zoom way out, now pull out in big moves, pulllll***</span></p><p id="583"><span id="584">10:53:30 AM</span></p><p id="585"><span id="586">C: good, now you’re going to do a figure of eight, and you’re going to and do it again</span></p><p id="587"><span id="588">C: but that would be good, that stuff, it would help so much***</span></p><p id="589"><span id="590">10:54:20 AM</span></p><p id="591"><span id="592">C: now listen, just keep your left hand. (sw 10:54:38 AM)</span></p><p id="593"><span id="594">C: nope, not anywhere, D, it’s not anywhere, it has to bunch the tissue the way the stitch is gonna. You see that</span></p><p id="595"><span id="596">D: uh hum. It comes back much better</span></p><p id="597"><span id="598">C: so the needle need to incorporate all the tissue only if the retraction is appropraiate. Now you see how thiat (threw it) byunches it back appropriately? Now come in (sw 10:55:34 AM) and tie this, do a surgeon’s knot</span></p><p id="599"><span id="600">10:55:42 AM</span></p><p id="601"><span id="602">C: pull mostly with the right hand, so thte tail doesn’t get longer and longer and longer</span></p><p id="603"><span id="604">V and J inactive</span></p><p id="605"><span id="606">10:56:09 AM</span></p><p id="607"><span id="608">C: now lift up and sideways, mostly with the right hand. Yup. Good. Now let go of both, now this has to stay loose until the last second, until you’ve locked it down with a second knot. Loose, don’t pull up.</span></p><p id="609"><span id="610">10:56:46 AM</span></p><p id="611"><span id="612">C: now, knot up, only sideways. You know hy?</span></p><p id="613"><span id="614">D: if I pull up I’m going to loosen it</span></p><p id="615"><span id="616">C: yep. Now the rest is only gravy. So what’s the purpose of this stutch</span></p><p id="617"><span id="618">D: it’s the backbleeding stitch. </span></p><p id="619"><span id="620">C: yes, but what’s it function? Not fair to ask you to multitask, I know</span></p><p id="621"><span id="622">D: when we do the anterior dissection, we won’t have a lot of blood</span></p><p id="623"><span id="624">C: I don’t do this for bleeding even slightly. I do it only because it bunches up the tissue and it presents the bladder neck in a much nicer way. It contyours the prostate, it just presents the bladder neck. The dissection bleedes anywah, it doesn’t beled less because of that suture, so gather thaose two together rwith the rright hand, and grab</span></p><p id="625"><span id="626">C: I know people assume it’s for bleeding, but</span></p><p id="627"><span id="628">D: I know, that’s a good point</span></p><p id="629"><span id="630">10:58:48 AM</span></p><p id="631"><span id="632">D: allright, I’ll take this out</span></p><p id="633"><span id="634">C: so zoom back into the bleacher seats so he can take this out</span></p><p id="635"><span id="636">D: K, take this out</span></p><p id="637"><span id="638">K: sure</span></p><p id="639"><span id="640">C: bring yourself closer to the camera, you’re making him reach impossibly far into the pelvis.  </span></p><p id="641"><span id="642">C: so all of his difficulty right now is your fault. You should hand off sutures like this, like pouring out a carton of milk, so he can get access to it.</span></p><p id="643"><span id="644">11:01:23 AM</span></p><p id="645"><span id="646">C back in (sw 11:01:43 AM)</span></p><p id="647"><span id="648">11:01:44 AM</span></p><p id="649"><span id="650">C adjusting console, ticks off 30 degree thing on console</span></p><p id="651"><span id="652">11:02:03 AM</span></p><p id="653"><span id="654">C: okay, let’s switch to a Maryland in the left.

Cause this for me is the hardest part of the case to visualize</span></p><p id="671"><span id="672">C: yes, it is. My eyes will dart around here . If this bleeds like crazy, I’m going to cauterize it. I’ll (head out) so it will be a big char, it’s like the hernia situation, you can’t bend a situation like that into being “oh, this is just fine” you have to stop and ask “oh, what am I doing wrong?” I can get out of it reasonably quickly. </span></p><p id="673"><span id="674">D: uh huh</span></p><p id="675"><span id="676">C: for me, the surgeons I try to emulate, they all got into trouble, but they recognize it so fast, and got out again, but they didn’t compound a distuation and make it worse. It comes from a certain amount of humility, I have to say even after a thousand cases, I still think, I may not know what I’m seeing here. But if you look at a major error, it’s</span></p><p id="677"><span id="678">D: it’s a series of events</span></p><p id="679"><span id="680">C: exactly, we were talking about a ureteral injury after a dissection, it wasn’t my case, the ureter wasn’t just injured, okay? There was a progression, there was a prolonged search for the vas, then there was talking myself into thinking that this is the vas, then cauterizing it, then dividing it, so it was like five or six steps, where you weren’t listening to yourself, knowing I’m in trouble, things are not looking right, for me, it’s not the injury, it’s the psychological process of convincing yourself that things are fine, and I told the residents involved in that case, can we take the cateter rodnw. The first response was it really looke dliek the vas, but on further questioning it was “no, it was a little weird, it was a little lateral”, so it was preventable, probably. ***</span></p><p id="681"><span id="682">11:10:49 AM</span></p><p id="683"><span id="684">C head out frequently to talk and gesture as he explains</span></p><p id="685"><span id="686">11:11:12 AM</span></p><p id="687"><span id="688">C: this is an unusual stitch, nobody else does that. </span></p><p id="689"><span id="690">11:11:35 AM</span></p><p id="691"><span id="692">C explaining why he sutures the way he does</span></p><p id="693"><span id="694">J rips out as X comes in</span></p><p id="695"><span id="696">11:12:36 AM</span></p><p id="697"><span id="698">C: okay, scissor</span></p><p id="699"><span id="700">A bit of a scramble with the new scrub tyring to find where </span></p><p id="701"><span id="702">C: just be careful not to bump arm three on your way in, cause that arm is holding something.
