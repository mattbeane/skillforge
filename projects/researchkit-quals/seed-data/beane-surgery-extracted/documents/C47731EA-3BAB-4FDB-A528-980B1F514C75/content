If you look at the cost of healthcare, the things that have risen are not physicians reimbursements, okay, it’s administrative costs, but the technology through the roof. Technology costs have gone up, and that’s what’s fueling a lot of this desire. If you look at every haircut healthcare dollar 30 years ago, about $.45, more than $.50 is coming to the physician. So for every dollar spent in 2012, the actual cost of care provided by the physician gets about 11 ½ cents on that dollar. The rest goes to you name it.</span></p><p id="5"><span id="6">If you were smart about eight or nine years ago you would have been a rep for the da Vinci. For intuitive and would have collected stock options, and essentially watched the stock split and split, cashed in those options a year ago, and retired on some island. And made a killing in a fortune because now nobody’s buying more robots, the hospitals don’t have money, they’ve run out of donors. This whole bullshit, this new model robot nobody’s going to buy it. Nobody has the money. So what the robotic companies are trying to do, they’re trying to make simple procedures like a gall bladder removal, a cholecystectomy, which is done laparoscopically, try to make it a robotic procedure. To try to increase the scope of surgeries that are done robotically. That’s what’s fueled this hysterectomy rage, it’s also fueled the rage in colorectal surgery. </span></p><p id="7"><span id="8">When you look at a robotic procedure, the hospital loses money on robotics. The hospital eats it. What operating margins to hospital’s operate on? Very low, very low margins. When you think of corporate America in terms of operating margins, like go down the line, Walmart, Market Basket Stop &amp; Shop, restaurants, whatever. You’re talking about 20, 30, 40% operating margins. As a hospital, if you have a 1% or higher operating margin, you’re in the top 10% in the country. How about them apples? So in New England, last year, there were only two hospitals that had a positive operating margin. One was this place. Had an operating margin of 3.4% which is phenomenal, and that’s because we have a good payer case mix, we don’t have a lot of Medicare in suburbia. The other was Mass General. So this is a key thing, so hospitals lose this money. But they fall under pressure from doctors, who say “look, we need to have this robot otherwise were to lose business.” That’s where the pressure comes from.</span></p><p id="9"><span id="10">But the companies are marketing direct to consumer. The patients are going online and say “Wow, robot, the next best thing since sliced bread.” They go on these blogs, and in a lot of ways, you look you can work for intuitive, and they’ll say “I’m going to hire you and go around to every blog and talk about how wonderful robotic surgery is.” So you’re hearing all these things about the robot, and all the stuff, and doctors alike, you know my patients to come and ask me I want robotic surgery. And I don’t do robotic surgery, so we either need to hire someone who does robotic surgery, or we need to get a robot and I need to learn it. And that’s what’s happening, more the latter rather than the former.</span></p><p id="11"><span id="12">Now if you go to Canada, Gina how many robots the whole country of Canada has? Four. Three or four, they had three last year, they may have for now. Four robots in the </span><span class="charFormat1" id="13">whole country</span><span id="14">. So Canada’s, you know, got socialized medicine whatever, but still, four robots. I think, we have four robots within a 20 mile span here. We have two here. So, there’s a lot of money in healthcare it’s not in providing care. </span></p><p id="15"><span id="16">If you gave them [surgeons] truth serum and said “Do you think the robot is a better operation than doing it laparoscopically?” they’ll tell you no. But they don’t want to lose the business because patients will seek out the robotic surgeons. Patients will seek out what’s hot.</span></p><p id="17"><span id="18">Three years ago the Celtics were in the NBA finals with the Lakers. At that time, a company known as the American medical systems had a greenlight laser that opened up, okay, that was used for prostate, for people who had Roto-Rooter type jobs like TURP, they marketed themselves as the green team. They marketed themselves with the Celtics during a hole playoff. And I kid you not, everybody who came in for that procedure was asking about the greenlight laser. To the point where, and I know the laser doesn’t work that well, and I know it’s sexy, but it doesn’t work quite as well as the other tools, it’s expensive as hell, and I have a presentation that shows this, but I said fine, let’s bring it in guys let’s do it, we brought it in for a few months, the doctors didn’t like it that much, didn’t provide any benefit, we didn’t buy it or lease it, nothing.</span></p><p id="19"><br id="20"/></p></body></html>
