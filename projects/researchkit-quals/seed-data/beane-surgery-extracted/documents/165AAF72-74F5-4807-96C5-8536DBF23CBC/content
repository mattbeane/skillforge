When I was working with T, it was so natural for him, and I’d say are you doing that for x reason, and he would say “yes, haven’t thought about it that way, but yes”. So I always rely on simple rules to get things done, I guess it came from struggling, that’s where it came from. </span></p><p id="1137"><span id="1138">12:55:51 PM</span></p><p id="1139"><span id="1140">N: []</span></p><p id="1141"><span id="1142">C: it’s the only way I can remember things, if somebody tells me, like what’s the (head out) situation </span></p><p id="1143"><span id="1144">C: when I was a fellow, they were doing their cases in brazil, everyone said no, and they ended up with me.

There were 3 surgeons doing 13 surgeries in 8 days, so I was there in the or teaching these surgeons, and there was one who had lap experience, and he needed only a little coaching, but the other two were open, and a couple things made it hard. So when we ran out of instruments, we ran out of instruments, that was it. And I tried the American thing where you complain and you get what you want, and they were like no no no, so we were having to manually override the system so we could use expired instruments, we didn’t have rv situates and we had to use sh needles, out of that week and out of necessity, I had to get people out of cutting the prostate in half, cutting the gastric, all but the most major snafus… , upper gastric injury, it was a crash course of how to get people out of trouble, and so for each step I had to take them out of the console and walk them through it verbally, it was like the wild west, so that week I learned SO much.</span></p><p id="1149"><span id="1150">N: I can imagine</span></p><p id="1151"><span id="1152">C: so first I figured I could get people out of trouble, and I was explaining how to handle things. So that week was a crash course, and the best part of the end of the week, they called me into this room, and they handed me a paper bag full of cash, it wasn’t a lot, but to me and I was able to buy furniture for my nursery, I had just finished fellowship. I only found out later that the only reason I got that job because nobody else wanted to go down. But apparently one of the more famous guys came down.</span></p><p id="1153"><span id="1154">What I learned from there, the instruments they matter, but it doesn’t really matter that much, you can get the job done a lot of different ways, it’s the strategy that matters, you just have to take a different approach. ***</span></p><p id="1155"><span id="1156">N: so you say most people don’t put the fourth arm on the right, what do they do?</span></p><p id="1157"><span id="1158">C: most people on the left. Surgeons odn’t want anything near the left hand. Everything’s flip floipped the surgeons of the right and the assistant is on the patient’s right, so their dominant hand is on the left hand side, some people will use the lateral trocar for suction, so to me the benefit is greatly reduced</span></p><p id="1159"><span id="1160">(C head out this whole time)</span></p><p id="1161"><span id="1162">1:03:30 PM</span></p><p id="1163"><span id="1164">C: no, A I susing </span></p><p id="1165"><span id="1166">C: suction here?</span></p><p id="1167"><span id="1168">N: suction would be on the left.

I want you to picture this, our stnadar meat and potatoes is progras fourth arm. Picture that. When we switch over to the fourth arm, what insturments do we have?</span></p><p id="1183"><span id="1184">N: Maryland and prograsp. </span></p><p id="1185"><span id="1186">C: and so those are two grasping insturments. So wehen we were figuring out how to do this, to try to set up two graspers, to set up retraction. Maryland and a scissor, and the other hand is the grasper, and the other is a scissor, which (head out) showing with hadns) so you end up doing a lot of one handed, which is not as efficient, so this was nmiotivated by two things, one is an assistant using their right hand, and being able to grab with two insturments. </span></p><p id="1187"><span id="1188">N: who came up with it?</span></p><p id="1189"><span id="1190">C: T.
