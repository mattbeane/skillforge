I would imagine that high volume centers would mean a significantly decreased setup time. </span></p><p id="7"><span id="8">Some institutions have dedicated robotics teams, with scrubs and nurses who do nothing but. We have that here, but not to the extent that other institutions do. </span></p><p id="9"><span id="10">Post-operative pathways are potentially different.</span></p><p id="11"><span id="12">You have a very different interaction with your assistant [in robotic procedures]. You’re not next to them – you’re spatially separated, you’re not next to them. Because you’re not directly next to them, you’re more apt to try to do something on your own. </span></p><p id="13"><span id="14">In open surgery, it’s very easy to take a break – give yourself a mental break by just stopping and chatting with everyone about something, or to look around the room. It’s much harder to do that when you’re in the console. Some way you have to get up, get out and make idle chitchat, even if it’s for 30 seconds. Sometimes, I actually make myself do that. It’s much obvious [in open procedures], but they do it. </span></p><p id="15"><span id="16">People who have been here a while often get specific conditions – Doug gets prostates or nephrectomies, already pre-diagnosed. As a new doc in the practice, I tend to get dedifferentiated cases. They might just have blood in the urine. Many of them don’t turn out to need surgery.</span></p><p id="17"><br id="18"/></p></body></html>
