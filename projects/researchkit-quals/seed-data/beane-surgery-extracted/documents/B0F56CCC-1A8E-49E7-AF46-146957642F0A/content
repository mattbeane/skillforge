It’s easier to stay with the herd.</span></p><p id="5"><span id="6">We meet monthly and all the robotic cases are on a spreadsheet it’s got your name it’s got procedure, the in time the out time, the total duration of the surgery, and how much of that surgeons block time is used as a percentage. And they calculated we argued about it for a long time, they calculated from 7:30 AM to 7 PM so they give us a 12 hour block and if you done too long cases and were done at 530, they say you are not using your block time. And so we argue all the time the administrators are arguing one thing, and were saying you can’t do more than that, it’s not, so we always argue about how they do the calculations.</span></p><p id="7"><span id="8">Whoever’s not utilizing their block time, they get reassigned to someone who doesn’t have enough block time, that’s looked at.</span></p><p id="9"><span id="10">If you don’t fill your block time from within two weeks of the OR gate, it’s open for anyone to use, but then it’s hard for other people to use cut is your scheduled in clinics and other places, right? If you’re not using it there’s a giveaway time I can remember if it’s a week or two weeks. They try to write it down for me, but they make it so complicated. I have liked Tuesday the first Tuesday and Wednesday of each month, the second Wednesday in the fourth Wednesday, those are the only days I do robots.</span></p><p id="11"><span id="12">It’s the OR executive committee, which the robotics committee reports to. The chairman of each department sit on the executive committee. So that’s where we get into the politics of block time or whatever.</span></p><p id="13"><span id="14">They would like to reallocate that time to someone else, because then they could charge more.</span></p><p id="15"><span id="16">I know, like you can manipulate this in some cases, it would be so easy if it’s not a complicated procedure and then you got someone with four prior surgeries and a BMI of 50, and so they have these averages of time that they apply to what you book, so they take your they take your current average time, they have your current average time for each robotic procedure, I have it printed out there. And if you fill out your form and you’re too far off in your estimate, they set your time-based on the average of your last 10 cases I think.</span></p><p id="17"><span id="18">So it gets noted if you start to slow down.</span></p><p id="19"><span id="20">We preferentially use number 17, it’s a better system, and no one really wants use the old one. And so for cancer staging, you can’t do it on the old one because they don’t have the fluorescence technology if you want to do Sentinel luminance. So that’s a reason to use 17. So for colorectal, their new stapler sealing system or whatever, it can only be in 17, so people would use that as reason to book in that room. And then the old one you would only use it if you really need to get cases done and 17 wasn’t available.</span></p><p id="21"><span id="22">And it’s simple you’ll do it on the old one. If you do it on the old one, you can’t do dual console obviously if you’re teaching. </span></p><p id="23"><span id="24">Initially it started in a different OR altogether, when it first came it was in a really small I think OR number 1, a urology room, it was </span><span class="charFormat1" id="25">so</span><span id="26"> small, I actually have pictures because it was dangerous, and I complained, because I said if you had a code, there would be no way to access the patient. Like they took a patient in my room and left the cords on the stretcher, and I took pictures and I said, no.</span></p><p id="27"><br id="28"/></p></body></html>
