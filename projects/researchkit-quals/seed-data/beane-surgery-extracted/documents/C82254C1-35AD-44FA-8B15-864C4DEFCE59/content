In order to make the robot pay for itself, you need to use it. </span></p><p id="5"><span id="6">Urology was the only service who is using it, it was not general surgery or colorectal, gynecology, nobody was using it. So the administration pushed one, for us to have higher numbers and two, to have other services involved. </span></p><p id="7"><span id="8">The push for other services to get on board from administration, that had also to do with utilization, or was that something else? Yeah, no, definitely, because it was the same robot shared with other services, so the idea is that the robot has to work whole day, every day. So that we can repay the initial cost.</span></p><p id="9"><span id="10">It’s very valuable, we have assigned days to the robotic rooms and, you know in mind day on Monday morning, I have the new one. But it clearly it is a competition to have the new one, and nobody wants to use the old one. in most of the time the old one is used for example if I have a case that I cannot get into room 17, and if I have to do that I have to wait three or four months, I will ask for if there is some time to use the other robot in order to get the case there. These are divisions between services, and among the services within physicians. And I guess everybody pays their share of pain using the old one in one way or the other.</span></p><p id="11"><span id="12">The pain from my, I don’t do as much robotic surgery, so I don’t as fine an impression as others but the pain is quality, the robot is definitely superior, the robot in 17, times that the robot breaks or gives you suboptimal pictures is much higher with the old robot. There are some features you can use on the new one, like having the ultrasound placing to the screen that you look at on the bottom that you cannot have with the old one, the pedal, the system the way the pedals are designed is much easier for the new robot, present to how to focus the camera is very easy with the new one, press on the camera pedal twist the rings, and there have a focus, the old robot is completely different pedal that you have to use to focus every time, so it’s much easier. It’s not a big deal, but it’s just one more thing to do. So, you know, these are all subtleties, but if you do it [work with one system] it becomes an automatic, you achieve some autonomy so you do some movements automatically, [so] switching from one to the other is a pain, and using the old one is a pain.</span></p><p id="13"><span id="14">Sometimes there are conflicting cases, and there are times where there are more than one surgeon, and one where they need to do a robotic case, and the choice is either not do it or use the old one. So, for example if I have let’s say one Friday we have two robotic cases, one is me and one is Dr. canes, somebody has to use the old system, and there’s no way around it, so clearly everybody prefers to use the new robot. It’s the same thing[as to how we work it out within urology and between departments]. If it’s my room, I have a new robot, and the other surgeon will use the old one, if it’s the other way around, then the competition is not day by day, competition is at the beginning to decide who’s going to use the new one, whose can use the old one. Some people claim that they cannot use the old one because they were never trained on the old one, but the differences between one and the other are not such that justifies that. As in everything else there is a competition for the robot.</span></p><p id="15"><span id="16">In theory, the decision should be revisited every few months, in reality that doesn’t happen. Every other Monday I’m in 17. About two years ago we had a meeting in the robotics committee to decide how to divide up the robotics time, and it’s basically that pattern has continued to this day. With adjustments, because we hired gynecologists who knew robotic surgery, you know, there are other people who are going to be using it.</span></p><p id="17"><br id="18"/></p></body></html>
