He said that some people do these procedures robotically, single port. He was talking with someone coming on soon, currently a fellow at B&amp;W, about trying to start up a robotic gall bladder practice. D said he wasn’t trained on the robot, and that a lot of the gen surg use of the robot is driven by intuitive, that they’re really pushing the expansion into gen’l surg. And part of it is that we’re a minimally invasive fellowship program, so people if they come here, we feel like we really ought to teach them this technology. ***</span></p></body></html>
