Cleveland had the fourth robot in the country. For a while the robot sat idle, nobody used it for anything. </span></p><p id="11"><span id="12">Dr – prostatectomy was the first. Guy in Detroit – Manny Mennen. Had  - he started in 2002. Vip patel, 2005, done 200. Now he’s done 6000. If you get in early, you get lots of cases.</span></p><p id="13"><span id="14">New to robot – basically, the entire roboti system, how you place your ports – little different on ports, instrument choices were less in the beginning, so you had to have different skills.</span></p><p id="15"><span id="16">	Only two arms in addition to arm, no clips that you could put on yourself, back then had to use assistant. Rudimentary scissors – it was a hook. Now we have scissors. Had to use the assistant’s grasping arm to help move the prostate around and grab the bowel. Now we have a prograsper.</span></p><p id="17"><span id="18">	Changes in system over time – started with that system I just described, lack of HD, SD, visual acuity was a major downside. Robotic arms had a greater limitation in terms of their range – how far to left and right – very limited for kidney surgery – couldn’t do that originally. Started all the way up. Then it went o 760 then 1080p. Surgical range helped increase spectrum.</span></p><p id="19"><span id="20">Started in urology and stayed in urology for a long time. Then went over into gyn and stayed in there for 1-2 years, then next was cardiac. Then after that gen surg. Some of this more has to do with the marketing – urologist were early adopters without looking for evidence to support its use, times have changed and there are bigger pushes on cost containment, given this envoironmment, I believe this specialties will pay careful attention to cost and so on</span></p><p id="21"><span id="22">Reason why urology – has to do with historically, urology has been a field that has adopted technologies because of our use of endoscopes. Cystoccopy started with looking into bladder, then ureteroscopy (2</span><span class="charFormat1" id="23">nd</span><span id="24"> gen), smaller fiber optics then lasers, came by and stone work then work with tumors. Then next step was laparoscopy, general surgeons started using it with the gall bladder, then once that was figured out, it wen tto some work wit hthe appendix, hernias, then urology, because they were facile using , </span></p><p id="25"><span id="26">Started off with kidneys then to prostates, prostates were hard, they started and they failed. </span></p><p id="27"><span id="28">Extra pedal – that’s the way I learned – when I did lap, I had bipolar on left foot, then monopolar on right, so I just transitioned to robot. When first robot came out, then I put pedl on side, </span></p><p id="29"><span id="30">You absolutely must do the simulator – that’s a must do to understand this thing.. </span></p><p id="31"><span id="32">Ultimate learning has to occur in OR, as simulators improve over time. As that improves, more and more of the learning will occur out of the operating room. At</span></p><p id="33"><span id="34">Greater than 95% of the learning comes from the OR (and that’s a fake figure. Could be three times that in the other direction.)</span></p><p id="35"><span id="36">Training:</span></p><p id="37"><span id="38">Lap and open – you’re standing open, standing physically adjacent and standing next to patient. With robotics there’s separation, it’s presents its own unique challenges and opportunities for teaching. Dual console is easily the way to go. </span></p><p id="39"><span id="40">Single unit is disruptive having to have the resident to sit there and going back and forth, not looking at what they’re looking at – telestrator isn’t the best, it’s like Madden – only – shows one – you could put it sort of close to the resident, but not so close. </span></p><p id="41"><span id="42">Lap and robotics: open, and in lap, you can grab instruments, and point out exactly what you want done, or manner in which you want instruments to be helped</span></p><p id="43"><span id="44">With dual console you can take over case, you can’t show them how (I ask about modeling it)</span></p><p id="45"><span id="46">There is a simulator that allows for guided in reverse. ROSS developed in buffalo – they’ve decided to teach someone. Expert case, prostatectomy, goes through the hole whing, fingers, and . I think it’s bullshit. I think I could have my kid do that, and I’m not sure how many neurons would be developed.Every case is different. It’s impossible – very difficult to program all the different layers to make it realistic, so many layers, so many chances for bleeding, injury. **you need theory**</span></p><p id="47"><span id="48">Speaking volume – if I had come a month earlier with last crew that was in there, it would have been must different - bedside assistant, there’s a huge role factor for experience for them. In places where I’ve operated with the same person continuously, there’s almost no communicating hat occurs verbally, perceived lack of communication and potential negative aspect of the other is minimized.</span></p><p id="49"><span id="50">4 months for a chief is long. His bar for a good resident, trained properly – would I trust them to operate on my wife, on me. If I had to do surgery.</span></p><p id="51"><span id="52">People that need to be functioning at a high level, they need to be doing a fellowship, then you refine it. But at the end of the day no matter how you slice and dice this, you’ll still be learning when you do this on your own on the first cases you handle yourself. If you get the biggest learning curve in the first few months, if you had to draw a graph, you have a steep learning in the beginning then there’s another steeper learning when you first go out on your own.</span></p><p id="53"><span id="54">Steep is during first fourth mohths, then after then another step comes , it’s kind of like growth you have as a baybythen slower growth, then puberty you grow rapidly. </span></p></body></html>
