They have no interest in being efficient, none whatsoever. If they wanted to, they could make the whole process efficient, but they’re only paying lip service. That’s why they can do three in a day over at the Faulkner and only two over here. People hate that robot, I hate it too. It’s boring!</span></p><p id="25"><span id="26">7:38:16 AM</span></p><p id="27"><span id="28">Richie in. </span></p><p id="29"><span id="30">Patient out. </span></p><p id="31"><span id="32">7:39:00 AM</span></p><p id="33"><span id="34">R, J, D out to wash</span></p><p id="35"><span id="36">7:39:07 AM</span></p><p id="37"><span id="38">It’s anesthsia’s fault. The manager, nobody came by to let us know we were short an anesthesiologist. Normally, Richie, but it makes a huge differentce whose in the room, it makes a huge difference who is in the room. Kibel is not as detailed as Richie is. He’s a little more flamboyant. I have a different perspective, </span></p><p id="39"><span id="40">Now the problem with the robot is the robot has begun, the people who initially started with the robot here initially they picked were the wrong people. The first thing I would have done is gone to the place where they do three in a day, and the boss went over there, but he wasn’t involved in the process here, so they came in absolutely totally blind in my opinion, and the person running things was looking for overtime, in my opinion, and when ORs focus on overtime, guess what happens – things slow to a </span><span class="charFormat1" id="41">crawl</span><span id="42">. But the other thing is its totally boring. It’s not just inefficient, for the non-surgical people, you can’t understand what’s being said between the surgeon and the assistants. The audio system is so bad, I’ve showed them how to make it perfect, I brought in a device that I showed it make it perfect, they admitted it was perfect. I’ve got it at home. But now it’s mhmhmhm. But becaue you can’t hear anything clearly, you have no idea what they’re doing, so when you’re a secondary person like me, you have no idea what they’re doing because you can’t hear. It’s very simple fix and the hospital ddoesn’t want to dela with it, the hos;ptial feels that since they peyed for it, it should be perfect. The audio is a major problem, it takes twice as long to do everything, and that’s often in part because of all the peripherals. And because it takes longer it’s more expensive. If you analyze what it costs to do that operation in there and what it costs in here, it’s double. Easy. And I hope that keeps up, because they’ll eventually realize that the outcomes aren’t any different and it’ll be out of here. </span></p><p id="43"><span id="44">I look at the davinci robot whose time has not yet come in that application. But there’s no question that the Faulkner does it better, but they’re willing to do it better, and they respect their people more and if they gdo a good job they go home early, and that’s a </span><span class="charFormat1" id="45">major major</span><span id="46"> thing here. And incentivization is </span></p><p id="47"><span id="48">And nobody’s truly looked into incentivizing here. </span></p><p id="49"><span id="50">Because there’s no interest in being efficient at this institution, none whatsoever. </span></p><p id="51"><span id="52">7:49:01 AM</span></p><p id="53"><span id="54">Bout seven weeks ago, I made a list of all thine things that should be pulled at night by the night staff who are sitting there doing nothing, so you woulnd’t have to wait for stuff.

They shouldn’t write it up, we should give it to them. And so a whole list - three times I gave it to the iadministrators, not one, not two, but </span><span class="charFormat1" id="55">three times. </span><span id="56">What got done? Anything? Nothing.

You don’t even know you’re being fucked. For example, if I want to delay the patient coming in here, I just make the call to release the patient from the pre-op. They will tell me ten minutes, and you’re sitting there 10 people. The smart ones know how to drag it out. And there’s a reason to drag it out. You’re incentivized to go slow. Not fast.

We’re talking about the bosses now, the bosses don’t care, the hospital cares, you take my its 50k you can take right of the budget at the end of the year. They don’t look at this stuff. </span></p><p id="135"><span id="136">Years ago, we used to put in implants, in people, we had a room like this and every implant you could imagine would be on the shelves. The sheves were stocked by the company. No one had any issues, there was no tacking, non! I said to them, you know, you’ve got millions of dollars of materials in that back room, we need to have someone taking an interest in it. So somebody listened to me and they hired some poor bastard. He said you need to hire other people. There’s no tracking of any of this stuff, when it’s coming in, going out same people could be taking it out. Stuff was ending up in maine medical. I need at least two or maybe even three more people to do this job. They fired him for not being able to do the job. There are now five or xix people do ing inventory control and that’s just for the operating room. They’s nobody looking at this sort of thing. Now there is. </span></p><p id="137"><span id="138">8:43:56 AM</span></p><p id="139"><span id="140">The atmostphere isn’t welcoming to people hwo have good ideas or who have ideas that make the boss look bad because they didn’t think of it themselves. </span></p><p id="141"><span id="142">If they had efficiency people looking at everything in the hospital, they would be astonished bey</span></p><p id="143"><span id="144">When you get the biggest action out of hospital is when you penalize them for it.

It’s more marketing And if they can prove to them that the new robot would help them compete with another hospital</span></p><p id="147"><span id="148">They, all personally, are looking for ways to make things more minimalized and publish it. </span></p><p id="149"><span id="150">The million dollars over the course of the year I bet this hospital pays three million for the peripherals. </span></p><p id="151"><span id="152">And in my opinion you’re in the business of selling peripherals, and getting the robots out there, because every dummy needs a robot to show they can compete with their neighbors– but you’re in the business of making money on peripherals. And so I would look at it from a marketing point of view. </span></p><p id="153"><span id="154">He’s a robotic surgeon; he doesn’t have this guy’s hands. See the robot makes a bad surgeon look better. If you’ve got a tremor, it takes that out. It has magnification, so if you’re not a skilled surgeon, it makes you better. The kids that are good at the robot are not good open. But to be good at both means you have to actually say to yourself I’m willing to take twice as long as you can do it open. Then it comes back down to money. The residents are starting the case, they’re finishing the case, you’re in and out of the room in three hours, but the surgery takes six. </span></p><p id="155"><span id="156">9:00:13 AM</span></p><p id="157"><span id="158">The ones that push the hardest are the youngest one.
