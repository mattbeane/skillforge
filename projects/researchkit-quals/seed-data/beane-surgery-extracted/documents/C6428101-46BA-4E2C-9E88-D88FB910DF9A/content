Trying to replicate that has been hard. You almost never get the same team, it just breaks you, when the team leaves, you just feel the energy go out of the room. They’re not interested, and you’re thinking oh, my god, how are we going to get this case done – it literally added an hour to my case [to have people come in who don’t care]. </span></p><p id="15"><span id="16">Doug: this kind of team simulation is critical. There’s a study that the start/stop time adds hours to the case. You need two dedicated robotic teams that are stacked. They have to be anticipatory. Nobody should be standing around with their arms folded in these procedures – I have a ppt I share on this all the time. Teams need to be trained in case there is an emergent conversion. Especially if you’re down near the aorta or something, you need to be ready to move immediately, and in a coordinated way if something happens. Because I’m not scrubbed in, right? They need to know how to remove the instruments, sweep up the arms, and over to the side, someone backs out the robot and you get going with scalpels or whatever you need. </span></p><p id="17"><span id="18">Syll: She’s [Amira] the biggest asset we have right now. </span></p><p id="19"><span id="20">Roy: other places have made robot teams feel special</span></p><p id="21"><br id="22"/></p><p id="23"><span id="24">Interdependent items (constraints and goals):</span></p><ul style="margin-left:0pt; list-style-type:disc" id="25"><li id="26"><p style="text-indent:0pt; margin-left:0pt" id="27"><span id="28">Dedicated robot room</span></p></li><li id="29"><p style="text-indent:0pt; margin-left:0pt" id="30"><span id="31">Team training (esp. on emergent conversions)</span></p></li><li id="32"><p style="text-indent:0pt; margin-left:0pt" id="33"><span id="34">Evening is only available for simulator/simulation</span></p></li><li id="35"><p style="text-indent:0pt; margin-left:0pt" id="36"><span id="37">Negative robot culture</span></p></li></ul><p id="38"><span id="39">Syll: everybody should feel empowered and appreciated being on that team</span></p><p id="40"><span id="41">D: that’s key, I used to take them out, but the scrubs, they don’t get paid that much, and for them to take an evening away from their families, that’s tough, so I take them out for drinks, that’s just what I do</span></p><p id="42"><span id="43">D has scenarios to train (he said he’d send to Roy)</span></p><p id="44"><span id="45">Privileges/credentialing hadn’t been revised since 2009.

It would be nice to have urology approve this.” </span></p><p id="54"><span id="55">D: no one is happy since I came here, because there are a number of people who do only five cases a year. So the number of surgeons is going to go down, but those who are left will get more procedures, so it works out.”</span></p><p id="56"><br id="57"/></p><p id="58"><span id="59">It’s [credentialing] more relevant for GYN when you have a group, but for us it’s the…</span></p><p id="60"><span id="61">Syll: the indications are key – it should be used for the things that are extremely challenging laparoscopically.
