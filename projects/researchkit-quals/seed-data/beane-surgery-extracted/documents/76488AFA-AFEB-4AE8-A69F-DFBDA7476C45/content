I’m sure it will feel this new and raw for a while, but the first day in always feels amazing. Given the intensity of the situation, I think this was heightened. </span></p><p id="5"><span id="6">I saw more of the inside of a living human today than most everyone sees in a lifetime. We see more of outer space than this space. </span></p><p id="7"><span id="8">I was amazed at how the inflation process makes the anatomy on the screen seem almost like a textbook. There was the liver. There was the pancreas. The intestines. The diaphragm. But this person was LIVING. In the room with me. </span></p><p id="9"><span id="10">Controlling the camera carefully is key – you pay attention to the control of the manipulators, because that’s the movement you see, but you can only SEE that movement by virtue of the fact that the camera has been well placed. </span></p><p id="11"><span id="12">I really need to get some time on the simulator to get a better feel of what’s going on, but I was really quite struck by the movement of the robotic components in David’s control. They seemed lifelike – beautiful – coordinated – there was an element of beauty in some of his movements- sometimes the most efficient move was a challenging one, an elegant one, a surprising one – and he did it with effortless grace – like watching a figure skater do a crazy trick, a kung fu master block a punch – it’s an embodied expertise, but the kind I still marvel at when watching a seasoned backhoe operator – the machine seems like it’s alive and an extension of them all at the same time. There’s no apparent translation needed between intention and action. They’re fluid.</span></p><p id="13"><span id="14">Interesting: </span></p><ul style="margin-left:0pt; list-style-type:disc" id="15"><li id="16"><p style="text-indent:0pt; margin-left:0pt" id="17"><span id="18">getting up from the console to instruct or issue commands, walking across the OR. </span></p></li><li id="19"><p style="text-indent:0pt; margin-left:0pt" id="20"><span id="21">Two consoles – handing control of the same “body” (and by body I mean both the robotic components and the patient’s body) back and forth, like driver’s ed with a car. </span></p></li></ul><p class="paraFormat2" id="22"><span class="charFormat2" id="23">o	</span><span id="24">When one wasn’t in control, they saw the 3-d image, and could move their hands around to move a cursor on the screen with a little arrow, so they could ask questions and point. </span></p><p class="paraFormat3" id="25"><span class="charFormat3" id="26">§	</span><span id="27">The peak moment here was when David showed a motion in the surgical field using virtual hands, and Marc followed. </span></p><ul style="margin-left:0pt; list-style-type:disc" id="28"><li id="29"><p style="text-indent:0pt; margin-left:0pt" id="30"><span id="31">Unit only functions when the physician’s face is in the unit’s viewfinder.
