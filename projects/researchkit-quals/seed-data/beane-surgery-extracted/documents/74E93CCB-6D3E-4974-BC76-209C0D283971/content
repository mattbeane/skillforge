One owned and one leased. Just prior to me taking over, someone made the decision due to utilization that they were going to drop the second S. There was only one robot for a short period of time. DaVinci knows more about it than we do, honestly! I got involved and it became very clear – given that we picked up a lot of robotic surgeons, that we were struggling to get enough time on the robot. At the end of 2012 we brought on the Si. I was able to finagle – they had a “too good to pass up” deals at the end of the year. I got 7 or 8 hundred thousand off at the end of the year, so I got it then. </span></p><p id="5"><span id="6">We made the decision then, or maybe just prior to that, largely due to repair history, that we would no longer allow the robot to be transported around. You’ve seen it enough now to realize that it doesn’t take much to hit a door – it doesn’t take much to put it out of calibration. So we kept that in OR 17. That’s pretty much best standard around the country, you don’t want to be transporting that around. The Si moved into room 17, we already made it, only robotic cases would be done in 17, any of the folks, if they didn’t have enough robotic cases, and that was their block time, they would do non-robotics cases in that room, and we treat that thing like a CT scanner – it needs to be used all of the time – so we made that an exclusively robotic room. </span></p><p id="7"><br id="8"/></p><p id="9"><span id="10">100% of our rooms are devoted to block, except for trauma.</span></p><p id="11"><span id="12">Every room has a dictated block, and that’s how we manage and surgeons know where we want to be. We had a case where we could do </span></p><p id="13"><span id="14">That’s largely been a battle because we have a lot of smaller rooms. There’s not a lot of good rooms for that [robotics], so </span></p><p id="15"><span id="16">Definitely part of this is the public’s perception, The public’s perception is definitely that the robot is better no matter the procedure, and hospitals have to cater to that. </span></p><p id="17"><span id="18">Challenge is intuitive greatly influences the surgeons, there are actually two new ones out. It’s here or there if it’s that much better, but the capital is tough to come by. We look at block utilization, we want everyone to be up at 85%, it’s a hard number, overall, we’re at the mid to low 70s, probably more efficient than most. Robotics, hovers at maybe or 60 or 70 percent max, feb 59, jan 66, nov 70, October 61, we’ve never been able to get them efficient, and it took me a while to figure out why, and largely it’s the surgeon. Robotic runs longer than other rooms, our approach is like a CT scanner, so run it as long as you can, but most of the surgeons can’t run 12 hours a day, a lot of them will run a couple of cases and so the next four hours is dead time, and we haven’t been excellent at slotting someone in after that. They want the next robot of course, and I tell them I’m more than happy to get another one but you’ve got to get utilization up to 80% percent. And I know and they know they can’t do that. </span></p></body></html>
