So it makes a huge difference.”</span></p><p id="5"><span id="6">I told him I used the simulator, and he got very curious. I said I didn’t realize that it gave you force feedback, but not on the patient, on whether you’re doing something “illegal” with the robot – it gives you mechanical feedback. He agreed, and then described a number of such issues: sometimes, in the beginning, the arms get fouled up/they clash, and you’ll feel some resistance, but you won’t know why, then you have to back the camera up to see. He said in the beginning that he was constantly moving the camera in, doing some work, then moving it out to see where the arms were, then back in, cutting, then back out, etc. He said now he’ll move one of the other arms when he can’t see it (behind his field of view), but tha the rarely if ever did that in the beginning, because he’d end up clashing. And he said he could really understand how some surgeons did damage if they weren’t all that familiar, if they were moving an arm off screen, they could tear a bowel, etc. </span></p><p id="7"><span id="8">He also said that more experienced surgeons will clutch more frequently, keeping their hands more or less in front of them, whereas newer surgeons will end up with their arms and hands way off up and to the side (did a ballet like pose to demonstrate) until they realize they’re hung up or can’t move any farther (getting resistance from the machine). Also, he said if you try to twist the manipulator too far, you’ll start to feel resistance. </span></p><p id="9"><span id="10">When he took the job, Libertino had been talking with Parkland about setting up a program: they had said they were interested, but they had no urological surgeons who could use the robot and no robot. L. asked Canes whether he’d be willing to set up the program up at Parkland, C said yes, and C said he’s pretty proud of that because now there’s a group of urologists at Parkland, they’re starting general surg and cardio-thoracic, and there’s a reasonably-sized gynecological practice too.</span></p><p id="11"><span id="12">Mikey said that there are two basic approaches to the prostate – anterior and posterior. Posterior (I think), in his view, is better, because  you don’t have to go searching for the seminal vesicles, once you dissect down that way it’s pretty straightforward, you can keep the prostate and vesicles in view. He said some surgeons are just better than others, and there was this one woman who he tried to persuade to do a posterior approach, and she just wasn’t comfortable, and he said he didn’t want to remember the number of those procedures they had to convert to open because she just couldn’t get oriented, couldn’t see what she needed to see in order to do the work. </span></p><p id="13"><span id="14">Mikey spoke a fair bit during the procedure, trying to help me understand things. </span></p></body></html>
