I consider that a waste of time, for the reasons we just outlined, you have to be multiple different places, I can probably, I’m very happy with my outcomes when I’m doing surgery this way, it’s fast, it’s easy. The trouble is is when you go to doing things like rectal cancer. His taking out the rectum is a much different story than taking out the colon. When we go to take out the rectum, now working in a small space, relatively fixed space, so we still do it laparoscopically but it’s not as easy. So now if you get all this out of pelvis, this is a female pelvis which is relatively wide. </span></p><p id="5"><span id="6">The robot gives you wrists, you know, like hands, and it just sort of makes it simpler, in some ways. So people have said, well, can we do that [pelvic] portion of the case better with the robot? So then, to me it becomes, like a math thing, right? So am I going to mobilize this entire force of people, and this big machine that’s expensive, to just do this one portion of the case? </span></p><p id="7"><span id="8">Part of the other issue with the robot though is it’s not, just as you know how to do surgery one way, it’s not necessarily, it’s intuitive but it’s not totally intuitive. So, in rectal cases are not super comment, we do a bunch of them, but as that’s what we do, but it’s not like that’s the majority of your business, right? So in order to get good at manipulating this machine, you got to use the machine a lot. So that’s one of the reasons that we’ve gone to using it on sort of left-sided cases. So that we get familiar with the technology, then when we have to use it for a big case we can use it with ease.</span></p><p id="9"><span id="10">Here, the guys dissecting the rectum away from the seminal vesicles and the prostate. The challenge, it’s very challenging to do all this with straight laparoscopy like I just showed you, it’s almost impossible actually. In my hands, I would probably not do this laparoscopically, I would make an incision and do it open. And frankly this part of the case I wouldn’t be able to see anything. Like I would do it just by feel. Because the way the rectum is positioned it’s under the shelf of the pubis so it comes down like this? And once it goes under that pubis, which is this part, I can’t see anything. So what the robot does, so usually what you end up doing is like, feeling with your fingers, puttin’ the instrument down there, buzz on my finger, and you’re doing it literally all by feel. And surgeons are used to be able to see stuff now, in laparoscopy. Like we can see what we’re doing. The robot is attractive, because it’s like “oh, wait, I can see that, the robot can go underneath there, and I can maybe see what I’m doing, and maybe I can do a better operation.” So that’s the whole thing. Now whether that actually, I mean, results in any benefit, I don’t think any of the studies show that.</span></p><p id="11"><span id="12">I took it to the group, and I was like, you know this is something we should think about, I’d like to start doing it. I think there was a lot of attachment to laparoscopic way of doing things, and it’s worked for them very successfully for a long time. So I don’t think there was any much interest. But I think what happened in those next few years is that a lot of the other big training programs started to pop up with people doing robotics. So, it’s almost like peer pressure in a way, see what I mean? </span></p><p id="13"><span id="14">The thing to realize is that every year there is some new thing that’s supposed to be the best thing ever that’s can a revolutionize everything. So people are naturally judicious in doing these things. But I think, I don’t think the robot’s going away, you know. I think it’s here to stay, it made be different in the future, but it’s going to be around.</span></p><p id="15"><br id="16"/></p></body></html>
