The person I worked with and took it on. </span></p><p id="5"><span id="6">How did he go from skeptical to raving fan?</span></p><p id="7"><span id="8">I will tell you the robotic instrument and that’s basically its just a big giant instrument is kinder to the surgeon’s body, because they can sit down, and they get a better vision which is that 3-d vision, they lose a tactile sense, but they, plain laparoscopic surgery is two sticks basically because they’re straight, I mean  they’re starting to articulate some instruments now, but back then, your needle drivers, your graspers everything was straight the da Vinci instruments articulate, and it’s the 3-d vision, when you look in that screen, we get a 2-d vision, they in the console get a 3-d vision. It’s amazing to see, it’s amazing. At first, he didn’t like it, it’s a big giant, like Arnold schwarzenneger type german, just a huge, and he didn’t like it. So he tried 2-3 cases and he went ‘aahhhh’ and he went back to laparoscopic after the first two and on the third one I think he liked it. And to be honest, you can do three cases in a day, because you’re sitting. So you increase production. You know you’re standing for just a short time, when you’re placing the trocars and when you’re closing. For the rest of the case you’re sitting down. So your head is in there and you’re doing that. Not that its not difficult, I mean its difficult, but not… standing there at patient’s side, you know looking up, and doing this, so it would strain their bodies, not that they can’t do it, because we still do laparoscopic cases of course, but…</span></p><p id="9"><span id="10">The patient sees the surgeon, the surgeon books the case. I mean like, sometimes they’re booked out two months, it depends, so you have to fight for robotic time, because you only have the two robots. One’s a newer robot with the surgeon’s with the second console so the resident can sit and learn. We have another one, an older model that gets pulled out hopefuly a few times a week and is put into a different room and it only has the one console, so when the attending is teaching, if he wants to let the resident do something, he has to jump up, let the resident sit down, get acclimated, and do so if he does something that maybe he needs ot be corrected on, he has to get up and the surgeon has to sit down. So that’s the one we don’t like to use but we use it. You do fight over the good one. </span></p><p id="11"><span id="12">You have a pick ticket, it’s like a preference list that’s three or four pages, that tells what kinds of equipment to pick, what kind of sutures, what instruments, what room its going to be in, it has the patients name and procedure. So we call it s apick ticket or preference list. So that hopefully gets picked the night before. You come in in the morning, and most of the stuff overnight, but most of the stuff is there [in the OR], and its picked overnight. Its not set out or opened up. You get all the instrumentation you need, you have to prepare the robot, you prepare sutures, you just get the instrumentation, like lined up and ready to go. You have to drape it [the robot], and calibrate it. You have to calibrate the lenses, it’s a zero degree or 30 degree up or down. And what you do is make sure the lenses are calibrated, so that they’re ready to use. Your vision would be off [without doing it]. There’s little buttons, its like internal. You’re looking at the monitor, or the nursing assistant or someone whose in there, you just put the lens into the camera, you just put it on, and it will line it up and it makes sure, you press a few buttons and it puts itself through its own test. That stuff is happening anytime between 6:45 and 7:15. </span></p><p id="13"><span id="14">One of the nurses will go out and see the patient and do a pre-op visit, just make sure consents are obtained, patient’s had a bowel prep, you know, they’re doing the right procedure, it’s the right person, there’s nothing else that’s missing. The patient is also seen by surgery, preop nurses, anesthesia, resident sees them, that all gets done, they bring the patient to the room. So identify the patient again, make sure we know what we’re doing, have the right antibiotics, everything’s moving along. Move them over to the bed, goes to sleep with anesthesia. </span></p><p id="15"><span id="16">So far, this all sounds like open, lap or robotic procedure</span></p><p id="17"><span id="18">Absolutely. But if you’re doing an open procedure you have more instrumentation to get ready, you don’t necessarily need to calibrate anything. You never know, all facets of surgery have their own little specialty things that they work with. </span></p><p id="19"><span id="20">Start of </span></p><p id="21"><span id="22">So patient gets intubated, gets positioned, then we’re ready to start the case. We do a universal time out its called, so it’s the WHO (world health organization) timeout that is basically following along the lines of the airline industry, how they do their pilots in the cockpit do their little checklist. It happens, you do the same thing day after day, you can almost walk through it, but hen next thing you know, the wrong kidney’s out. That’s why we always check everything’s marked, you can see the marking once the patient’s draped. Everyone’s aware, we’re good timeout people. Absolutely. Then the case starts. </span></p><p id="23"><span id="24">You stay with us and you see what happens, not so much disperses, hustle hustle and get the next one up and running. The attending is gone to talk to family members, and to do other things. The residents go with the patient to PACU, their orders are usually written </span><span class="charFormat1" id="25">in</span><span id="26"> the room, it depends on how long it takes to wake up the patient, all these various factors. So they go out there they probably either dictate or write their note, or finish whatever they have to do. And then they’re off because they have a long list of things to do. The nurses in the room if our case is done, sometimes you’re lucky and you don’t have to go to another case, or go to lunch or cover a lunch or do a lunch, so sometimes that’s where you see…</span></p><p id="27"><span id="28">They do try to keep teams together, meaning, they’ll say there are no private scrubs, they’ll say there are no private scrubs, but the OR is riddled with them. It’s almost like an unwritten rule, like K and I work together probably 90% of the time. We don’t share the same day off, but we’re just a team that kind of gels and just works really well together.</span></p><p id="29"><span id="30">Why no private scrubs?</span></p><p id="31"><span id="32">Because some can say because I don’t scrub for him, so and so scrubs for him. So, say somebody’s difficult, and nobody wants to scrub for that person, you know what I’m saying, “Oh, I always scrub for Ali, or I always scrub with Dave.” So it’s… because medicine has gotten so technically advanced, it’s hard for me, I don’t know everything about colon/rectal, I don’t know all about their staplers or what sutures they throw, so it’s nice they don’t even have like Dr. points out and Dr. canes they know if the two of us are in the room or even one of us it’s not as good but it’s good. That they will be fine, it will be smooth even if something horrible happened. We happened to be a strongly gelled team. And that comes from them, it does work its way down, they’re good to us were good to them.</span></p><p id="33"><span id="34">Huddle?</span></p><p id="35"><span id="36">It should happen every case. Okay, so the case is finished, surgeons are done, attending gone, resident writing a note. Anesthesia extirpation patient. Before the attending leaves, we have a debriefing process. And it could be really informal, you know I could say something with someone uncomfortable with okay were debriefing, cases scheduled these are your specimens okay okay done. Any problems? And I would know that there are problems if I’m in a case where I don’t know them as well, you know, would you like to debrief, it was the case as scheduled and they’ll tell you straight out what it was and they will say if there were any equipment issues or any systems failures and anything happened like it today, I did two urology cases and I did a Neurosurgery case. So craniotomy. Mattel you probably a little bit less than thrilled when I saw my assignment yesterday. And I thought uhhh! I do that about for 30 seconds, what even a do it is what it is up a fine. The nurse that I was with one is a nurse to she scrubbing and she’s very strong. So she circulating for me, and we flipped roles I circulated with her so for the first two cases it was Dr. Martino’s so I said you get the third case ready, I want to do everything for these first two cases, so I’ll even see the patient. So that’s where you have two nurses you can get into that. So that kind of set up our day. So to have a great day. Now the Neurosurgery stuff, it was an ultrasound. There was a cousa, which is just pieces of equipment that I don’t use every day, a brain lab. That’s crazy. Oh yeah just a different drills in their little, but I had Karen Piccolo who’s very strong in the end we got to the day, it was an awesome, it was a fabulous day. And again, this Dr. Ramachadran, is very nice, is very kind, he’s very good, but the room is fine. He comes in, he doesn’t know me from Adam, I’m sure their heart seizes a little when they walk-in and they see a face they don’t know, “are they good? Are they going to pay attention? Are they got shut up?” You know. it just went really well.</span></p><p id="37"><span id="38">Good robotic procedure?</span></p><p id="39"><span id="40">The help. Is the staff in the room, and the staff knowledge and comfort with the equipment. Obviously, you work with people you don’t certainly care about, or care for. But you still have to be professional because the bottom line is that there’s a patient on the bed, who’s got a get a good outcome, has to have a positive surgery. So good luck, wanted me to give you an ideal day. I come in the morning, I look at the board, you know that smart chart that has all the information I look and see who I have, the patient literally means nothing to me because I don’t know nothing about them. Oh, I’ve got an awesome surgeon, minus ECL just as awesome, we have a great nurse anesthetist. And I got my friend Kate. Women have a great day, Logan have a great day. We go again, the mood is in, everything’s fine, even if it hits the fan, were still fine, because I’m comfortable that these people are strong and will carry it through the day, and help carry the load I guess? In a way to ensure that the patient has a good outcome. So everything goes well, the trocar placements go wonderful, the dissection goes smoothly, and is not a lot of leaving, even if there’s a lot of bleeding, were to be fine, because we’re fine. A bad day would be, oh really him, okay I really don’t want to work with him but I will because I’m paid to, and the anesthesiologists though he disappears a lot, and the cRNA is a complete which, and easily working with it could be per name is Sally, oh my goodness, oh my goodness it’s good to be one of those, and again, all this happens in two seconds. And then you find, we got to do. And then you have to get through your day, you get three a day, it’s not as much fun, but you still have, the bottom line even if it goes bad, what would be bad, obviously would be something surgically related, like something like you cut across the nerve, or the media are major arterial bleed or something, where you have to open. We have to go from laparoscopic codes to me robotic, is just laparoscopic. To me. So, If you open, that means you open, you did an open surgery, again that is very minimal, that happens rare, very rare. But if I’m with one person I could, it could be a horrendous time, but if he was somebody else, it could be the same exact thing, and it’s just smooth as silk. And that’s the difference I think, it comes down to the people you’re working with.</span></p><p id="41"><span id="42">Again, I think it comes down to the skill set, sometimes you know the powers in the OR, you could leave at three, you can leave at five, you could leave it seven, you can leave at nine. So there are some days that Kate will work till 7P, from 630 till 7P, not to work till 330 or five, so it’s always who’s going to come in and take over who’s going to take over your spot, O God, not her. And again, you try to get the right mix in there, sometimes you can’t. Sometimes you don’t leave because the person walks in and they made technically be able to do it, but maybe not onto percent yet, social probably get to the case, and sometimes it can be “please don’t leave.” You know, one of those, and there’s a lot of time to stay, and stay into, and one time it was a really difficult day, in the case I think it was Kate and I we both left at 3 o’clock it was one of those, oh my gosh, we had to go one of those relief, it was not optimal, the people left in the room were not optimal. You don’t know the steps he is to tell you, the surgeon will have to tell you every little step he needs, I need this now, I need that now. You’re exchanging an instrument, and you’ve done it 6000 times, it’s going to go smoother than if you died for. So that makes a difference it can literally had 30 minutes to a case. You know cause your uncomfortable, that was probably one of the worst days. That we left somebody like that. Because, you have an hawk, you you done it a few times you should be okay, and then it turns out that it was really wrong decision.</span></p><p id="43"><span id="44">[31:55]</span></p><p id="45"><br id="46"/></p><p id="47"><br id="48"/></p></body></html>
