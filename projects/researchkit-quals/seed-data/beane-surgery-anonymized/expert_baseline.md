## Part 1: Top 3 Mechanisms

### Mechanism 1: Shadow Learning

**What it is:**
When approved methods for learning (legitimate peripheral participation / "see one, do one, teach one") fail due to technological reconfiguration of work, trainees who succeed do so through norm- and policy-challenging practices enacted opportunistically and in relative isolation. Three interdependent practices constitute shadow learning:

1. **Premature Specialization** - Focusing on robotic surgical technique at the expense of generalist training that residency programs expect
2. **Abstract Rehearsal** - Practicing on simulators, YouTube videos, and mental rehearsal when concrete, hands-on experience with real patients was the expected/prized learning method
3. **Undersupervised Struggle** - Performing robotic surgical work at the edge of one's capacity with little expert supervision, when norms and policy dictate close supervision

**Theoretical importance:**
Expands communities of practice theory (Lave & Wenger) by showing that when technological change allows experts to work without trainee help, legitimate peripheral participation breaks down. Trainees must learn through practices the community considers problematic but tacitly tolerates.

**Key evidence (quote IDs from this dataset):**
- Quote ID: q_3_13 (Discrete control) - Shows the AP giving step-by-step verbal direction, illustrating "helicopter teaching"
- Quote ID: q_3_14 (Digital participation, Resident) - Chief using cursor to point virtually, showing the mediated nature of robotic instruction
- Quote ID: q_3_21 (Teaching) - "Here's the trick" - AP getting up to give instruction, showing embodied teaching still matters
- Quote ID: q_21_1 (Temporal shifting) - "Don't tell anyone I said this" - Illustrates norm-challenging practices that go unsanctioned

**How I found it:**
Comparative analysis between open and robotic surgery revealed dramatic reduction in residents' hands-on time (from near-100% in open to ~5% in robotic procedures). Followed up with blinded matched-pair interviews of "exceptional" vs "average" learners - the exceptional ones all engaged in these three practices extensively.

### Mechanism 2: Technology-Mediated Participation Barriers

**What it is:**
The da Vinci robot reconfigures surgical work such that experts can operate without trainee assistance. Unlike open surgery where the AP needs residents' "four hands working together," robotic surgery concentrates control at the console. The resident is reduced to "the sucker" role (suctioning fluids) or brief, heavily supervised console time.

**Theoretical importance:**
Shows how technology designed for efficiency and precision inadvertently eliminates the participation gradient that enables skill transfer. The "zone of participation" shrinks dramatically.

**Key evidence (quote IDs):**
- Quote ID: q_3_10 (Zone of participation) - "sneaks over by robot, careful not to touch it" - Physical exclusion from the work
- Quote ID: q_3_19 (Screen suck) - Multiple monitors, but meaningful participation happens only at the console
- Quote ID: q_3_22 (Direction, Public, Teaching) - "Don't chase the blood" - Verbal direction replaces hands-on guidance
- Quotes with codes: Awkward setup, Awkward to use, Wrong robot setup - Technology friction compounds learning barriers

**How I found it:**
Detailed time-on-task coding of observation data. Residents in open surgery performed surgical work for essentially the entire procedure; in robotic surgery, they saw 10-20x less time on surgical task.

### Mechanism 3: Workaround Resilience & Portfolio Degradation

**What it is:**
When organizations acquire new technology versions, they allocate best resources (infrastructure, talent, cases) to the new system. Experienced workers assigned to the degrading older system develop workarounds to maintain outcomes. This creates a vicious cycle: workarounds reduce visible problems → management doesn't invest in fixes → system degrades further → more workarounds needed.

**Theoretical importance:**
Explains how organizations can maintain satisfactory outcomes on a heterogeneous technology portfolio while inadvertently stressing experienced talent and limiting exploration of improvements. The "venting cycle" with management allows frustration to be expressed without triggering change.

**Key evidence (quote IDs):**
- Quote ID: q_3_2 (Creating errors) - "How amazingly imprecise this whole thing is" - Shows frustration with technology
- Quote ID: q_3_4 (Planning, Props) - Workaround behavior: going to get supplies, improvising
- Quotes coded: Jerry-rigging, Bad supplies, General hassle, Frustration - Evidence of workaround labor
- Quote ID: q_3_17 (Efficiency, Safety, Tradeoff) - "Is it worth the injury?" - Expert navigating degraded conditions

**How I found it:**
Extended observation at one hospital with two surgical robots (older and newer). Tracked resource allocation decisions over time. Noticed experienced surgeons/staff developing coping strategies that masked problems from management.

## Part 2: Disconfirming Evidence

### For Mechanism 1 (Shadow Learning):
- **Disconfirming observation:** Some residents who didn't engage in shadow learning still got some robotic experience
- **How reconciled:** They got token exposure (~10 min/case) but never achieved competence. The gap between credentials (finishing residency) and actual skill (can do robotic surgery independently) widened for most trainees.

### For Mechanism 2 (Participation Barriers):
- **Disconfirming observation:** Dual-console systems were designed to facilitate training
- **How reconciled:** Even with dual console, the binary nature of control (surgeon has it or resident has it) and helicopter teaching meant residents got far less meaningful practice than in open surgery.

### For Mechanism 3 (Workaround Resilience):
- **Disconfirming observation:** Sometimes management did respond to complaints
- **How reconciled:** Responses were typically partial/temporary. The "venting cycle" allowed experienced staff to express frustration, feel heard, but without triggering systemic change. Management optimized for new system success.

## Part 3: What Makes Good Coding

### Signs of Strong Coding:
1. Codes capture **action/process**, not just topics (e.g., "Spotlighting" vs "Light")
2. Codes reveal **mechanisms** - how things work, not just what happened
3. Codes are **grounded in specific observations** - could point to exact quote
4. Codes show **relational dynamics** - who's doing what to whom
5. Codes evolve through iteration - early codes get refined, split, merged

### Common Mistakes to Avoid:
1. Coding at too high a level of abstraction (e.g., "Technology" vs "Screen suck")
2. Missing the **processual** nature - coding static categories instead of ongoing accomplishment
3. Premature theoretical framing - imposing concepts before earning them from data
4. Ignoring negative cases / disconfirming evidence
5. Not tracking **variation** - when does the pattern NOT hold?

### Red Flags in Student Work:
1. All codes are nouns, no verbs (missing the action)
2. Codes don't connect to each other - no emerging relationships
3. Can't point to specific quotes for each code
4. Theory appears before data - concepts applied rather than derived
5. No discussion of what surprised them or challenged initial assumptions

## Part 4: Code Families (for assessment design)

### Family 1: Learning & Skill Transfer
Codes: Teaching, Newbie, Newbie minding, Cheating to Learn, Direction, Verbal, Resident
Why they belong together: All relate to how surgical skill gets transmitted (or fails to transmit) between experts and novices

### Family 2: Technology Friction & Workarounds
Codes: Awkward setup, Awkward to use, Wrong robot setup, Jerry-rigging, Bad supplies, Inferior capability, General hassle
Why they belong together: All capture the friction of working with imperfect/degrading technology and the coping strategies that emerge

### Family 3: Participation & Access Management
Codes: Zone of participation, Spotlighting, Digital participation, Screen suck, Discrete control, Cross-role covering, Public
Why they belong together: All relate to who gets access to meaningful involvement in the work and how that access is managed

### Family 4: Temporal & Workflow Dynamics
Codes: Processing, Rushing, Pause, Temporal shifting, Scene change, Costume change, Disposing
Why they belong together: Capture the rhythm and flow of surgical work, how time pressure shapes practice

### Family 5: Interpersonal Strategies
Codes: Coaxing, Diffusing, Fishing, Giving ground, Inviting critique of focal work, second-guessing
Why they belong together: Capture the micro-political and relational work of navigating surgical hierarchy

## Notes for Assessment Design

### Level 1 (Multiple Choice) - Good test quotes:
- Quote q_3_17: "Is it worth the injury?" - Tests recognition of tradeoff reasoning
- Quote q_3_20: "If anyone sees tumor... please speak up" - Tests recognition of safety culture patterns
- Quote q_3_21: Teaching quote about holding instruments - Tests recognition of embodied skill transfer

### Level 2 (Open Coding) - Good quotes for student coding exercise:
- Quote q_3_13: Complex verbal direction from AP - Rich enough for multiple valid codes
- Quote q_3_14: Digital participation with cursor - Tests ability to see technology-mediated interaction
- Quote q_21_1: "Don't tell anyone I said this" - Tests recognition of norm-challenging behavior

### Level 3 (Full Analysis) - Good quote sets:
- All quotes coded "Newbie minding" together - Can student identify the learning barrier pattern?
- Processing + Rushing + Temporal shifting quotes - Can student see workflow pressure mechanism?
- Zone of participation + Spotlighting + Screen suck - Can student theorize access/exclusion?

## Matt's Analytical Notes

**What surprised me most:**
The tolerance for shadow learning practices. Everyone knew residents were doing these things, held them to be problematic, but no one stopped them because the alternative (incompetent residents) was worse.

**What I'd code differently now:**
Would add more codes for **temporal** dynamics - the rhythm of when residents get access matters as much as whether they get it.

**Key theoretical moves:**
1. Comparison between open and robotic surgery was essential - couldn't see the problem without the contrast
2. Blinded interviews prevented me from biasing toward "successful" patterns
3. Drawing on norm-challenging practices literature (Anteby, Bernstein) gave me language for what I was seeing
