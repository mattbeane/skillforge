# Foundation: Argument Construction (Draft)

> **Status**: Draft for faculty discussion. This is a proposed foundational skill that cross-cuts all numbered domains. Feedback on scope, placement, and whether this should be assessed separately is actively sought.

## What This Tests

The mechanical craft of building written academic arguments — paragraph construction, section-level architecture, transitions, citation deployment, and the specific argumentative moves that top journals in organizational studies expect.

This is not "good writing" in the vague sense. It is a specific set of learnable, assessable patterns that distinguish publishable prose from competent-but-unpublishable prose.

## Why It Matters

Every domain's Level 3 assessment requires the student to produce written work. A student who can identify patterns (D1), position a contribution (D2), extract mechanisms (D3), and choose a framing (D4) will still fail to publish if they can't construct an argument that moves a reader from puzzle to contribution across paragraphs and sections.

This skill is the medium through which all other competencies are demonstrated. It is not domain-specific — the same paragraph mechanics apply whether you're writing an introduction, a literature review, or a discussion section. A student who masters argument construction can execute any framing they choose; a student who hasn't will produce work that reads like a research report rather than a scholarly contribution, regardless of how good their underlying analysis is.

## Where This Came From

These patterns were extracted from close mechanical analysis of 9 exemplar papers published in ASQ, Organization Science, ASR, and AMJ (Beane 2023, Barley 1990, Bernstein 2012, Leonardi 2011, Brayne 2017, Beane & Orlikowski 2015, Karunakaran et al. 2022, Bailey et al. 2012, O'Mahony & Bechky 2006). The patterns converged strongly across papers and journals — they are conventions of the tradition, not quirks of individual authors. The only real variation is pacing (ASR compresses, ASQ expands) and whether contribution sections use explicit labels or embed them in paragraph flow.

## Core Competencies

### F.1 Paragraph Architecture

Building individual paragraphs that make claims, support them, and advance the argument.

**The pattern**: Every paragraph has three layers:

| Layer | Function | Typical length |
|-------|----------|---------------|
| Topic sentence | A contestable CLAIM — never a citation, never a description of what was done | 1 sentence |
| Evidence/elaboration | Citations, data, examples, logical development — must support the topic sentence specifically | 2-5 sentences |
| Clincher | Names a concept for the next paragraph, draws an analytical conclusion, or poses an implicit question | 1 sentence |

**Topic sentence types** (from exemplar papers):
- **Declarative claim**: "Organizations are torn between new and familiar technologies."
- **Gap claim**: "Prior research does not provide much insight into..."
- **Escalation claim**: "This problem is likely more pervasive than we know."
- **Classification**: "A second type of virtual work involves..."
- **Transition**: "The other relevant stream has focused on..."

**What it looks like**:
- Topic sentences state claims, then cite — never citation-first
- Evidence sentences use parenthetical citation stacks for consensus (3-6 citations) or engage individual studies in prose for exemplars
- Clincher sentences set up the next paragraph or draw a bounded analytical conclusion

**Common failures**:
- Opening a paragraph with a citation: "Barley (1990) found that..." (citation-first)
- Opening with narration: "In this section, we describe..." (no claim)
- Ending a paragraph without a clincher (the paragraph just stops)
- Evidence that doesn't connect to the topic sentence's claim
- All evidence parenthetical (no author-in-prose engagement with key works)

---

### F.2 Transitions and Cohesion

Connecting paragraphs so the argument moves forward rather than listing points.

**The dominant mechanism: lexical repetition + conceptual escalation.** The last sentence of paragraph N introduces a term or concept. The first sentence of paragraph N+1 picks up that EXACT term and adds a new dimension.

**Examples from exemplar papers**:
- P1 ends with "portfolio." → P2 begins "Technological portfolios present a significant challenge..."
- P2 ends with "perennial problem." → P3 begins "This technological portfolio problem is likely more pervasive and significant than we know."
- P3 ends with "transparency paradox." → P4 begins "To untangle the transparency paradox..."

**"The Turn"**: The moment where the argument pivots from "what we know" to "what we don't know."
- Mechanics: A single adversative conjunction ("However," "Nonetheless," "But," "Nevertheless") + short, sharp sentence, deployed after a longer consensus-building passage
- The contrast in paragraph length itself creates rhetorical emphasis — a long consensus paragraph followed by a short gap paragraph is more powerful than two paragraphs of equal length

**What it looks like**:
- Reading the first sentence of each paragraph in sequence tells a coherent story
- Key concepts thread from paragraph to paragraph
- The Turn is unmistakable — one word pivots the entire argument

**Common failures**:
- "Furthermore" chains — additive transitions that don't escalate
- Topic jumps — new paragraph starts a new topic with no connection to the previous one
- Multiple turns — pivoting back and forth between consensus and gap dilutes the argumentative force
- No conceptual threading — paragraphs could be reordered without loss of coherence

---

### F.3 Section-Level Argument Architecture

Building the macro-level arc of each major paper section.

#### Introduction Arc

Every introduction follows the sequence: **WORLD → PROBLEM → GAP → QUESTION → PREVIEW**

| Step | Function | Typical length |
|------|----------|---------------|
| WORLD | Establish the phenomenon or dominant understanding | 1-2 paragraphs |
| PROBLEM | Deepen/substantiate the problem's scope and stakes | 1 paragraph |
| GAP | Introduce tension, violation, or absence in prior knowledge | 1-2 paragraphs |
| QUESTION | State research question or purpose | 1-2 sentences |
| PREVIEW | Preview the study and findings | 1 paragraph |

Pacing varies by journal: ASR compresses steps 1-3 into a single paragraph. ASQ takes 3-4 paragraphs. But the sequence is invariant.

#### Theory / Literature Review Section

Three organizational logics:

| Logic | Structure | When to use |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| By research stream | 2-3 streams reviewed, then synthesis paragraph shows their shared blind spot | When your contribution sits at the intersection of established literatures |
| By concept/category | Types of a phenomenon, each gets a subsection, then introduce new type/context | When you're adding to or complicating a taxonomy |
| By funnel | Broadest concept → narrower → specific intersection → gaps | When your topic requires establishing multiple layers of context |

**The universal move**: Consensus-then-complicate. Every theory section builds a consensus position, then pivots with an adversative conjunction to show what the consensus misses. The consensus should be a genuine steelman — the strongest case for the position you're about to complicate.

**End of theory section**: Three rapid-fire moves in the final paragraph:
1. Restate the gap in one sentence
2. Assert theoretical/practical importance in one sentence
3. Introduce the empirical case — the word "study," "case," or "field" bridges to Methods

#### Discussion Section

**Opening move** — reconnect to the introduction's puzzle via one of two approaches:
- **Puzzle-Contrast-Finding**: Name the paradox or gap, contrast existing theory's prediction with what happened, state what the study found
- **Method-to-Finding Declaration**: Open with what the study's analytical approach revealed

**Contribution structure** (2-4 per paper, most commonly 3):
Each contribution paragraph follows: literature anchor → contrast/extension → mechanism description → implication → optional future research handoff

**Limitations**: Framed as boundary conditions, not flaws. Pattern: acknowledge limitation in one sentence, immediately pivot to why it doesn't undermine the theory or why it creates productive future work.

**Closing paragraph**: NEVER a summary. Two types:
- **Grand Zoom-Out**: Connect the paper to a larger question, future trajectory, or paradox
- **Pithy Paradox Restatement**: The paper's core tension restated in 2-3 memorable sentences

The final sentence is always crafted — through parallelism, paradox, literary quotation, or evocative language.

**What it looks like**:
- The introduction creates genuine intellectual suspense
- The theory section earns the right to state the gap by steelmanning the consensus
- The discussion makes the contribution explicit without just restating findings
- The paper ends on a note that lingers, not a note that summarizes

**Common failures**:
- Introduction that narrates "what I did" instead of building puzzle → gap → question
- Theory section that reviews literature comprehensively rather than strategically
- Discussion that restates findings instead of making contributions
- Closing paragraph that summarizes the paper ("In this paper, we examined...")
- No arc — paragraphs in a section could be reordered without the reader noticing

---

### F.4 Citation Deployment

Using citations structurally — as tools for building arguments, not as proof of having read things.

**Four structural functions** (these shift across the arc of a paper):

| Function | Where used | How it looks |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| **Consensus-building** | Early paragraphs establishing known territory | 3-8 parenthetical citations stacked after one claim. Volume IS the argument. |
| **Steelman-building** | Before the gap/turn | Citations assembled to make the strongest case for the position that will be challenged |
| **Showing absence** | Gap paragraphs | Citations used negatively — "X studied this, Y studied that, but none studied Z" |
| **Creating tension** | Mid-introduction or theory section | Two bodies of literature cited against each other — Position A vs. Position B |

**Two citation modes within paragraphs**:
- **Parenthetical** (dominant): For consensus claims. "(Barley, 2015; Lifshitz-Assaf, 2018; Bailey et al., 2010)." Signals "many people agree on this point."
- **Author-in-prose**: For specific exemplar studies that get 2-5 sentences of narrative treatment. "Leonardi's (2011) study showed that engineers assessed whether the technology enabled or constrained their next project." Signals "this particular study deserves attention."

**Direct quotes**: Used sparingly — 1-3 per theory section. Reserved for:
- Key definitions that anchor the theoretical argument
- Particularly vivid formulations from foundational sources
- Concepts the paper will explicitly build on or depart from
- Always with page numbers

**What it looks like**:
- Every citation cluster serves a named function — if you can't say whether it's consensus, steelman, absence, or tension, cut it
- The balance of parenthetical vs. in-prose shifts across sections (introductions are mostly parenthetical; theory sections mix both)
- Gap claims are notably UNCITED — they are the author's assertion, not attributed to others

**Common failures**:
- All citations parenthetical (no engagement with any individual work)
- Citation-first sentences (the citation leads, the claim follows)
- Citations as decoration (dropped in to prove you read, not to build an argument)
- Overcitation — consensus claims with 15+ citations signal insecurity, not authority
- Undercitation in theory sections — less than 2 substantive citations per paragraph reads thin

### F.5 Opening and Closing Moves

The specific craft of first and last impressions at the paper level.

**Three opening sentence templates** (from exemplar papers):

| Template | Example | When to use |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| **Broad Declarative** | "Organizations are torn between new and familiar technologies." | When you want alignment before disruption — say something the reader already believes |
| **Trend Claim** | "In the past decade, two major structural developments intersected." | When locating the reader in a specific historical moment or institutional trend |
| **Literary/Narrative Hook** | Leonardi's blind men and elephant epigraph | When you have a memorable analogy the entire paper will orbit. Rare — use sparingly |

**Gap statement mechanics**: (1) Name the prior literature, (2) say what it has NOT done, (3) state this as a specific empirical or theoretical absence about process or mechanism. The gap is always about mechanism/process — never vague "more research is needed."

**Discussion closing**: Two types:
- **Grand Zoom-Out**: Connects the paper to a larger trajectory, invokes the future, gestures at paradox
- **Pithy Paradox Restatement**: The paper's core tension in 2-3 memorable sentences

The final sentence should be quotable — through parallelism, paradox, or evocative language.

**What it looks like**:
- The opening sentence is punchy, short, and either uncited or lightly cited
- The gap statement is precise about what specific process/mechanism is missing
- The closing paragraph introduces a new frame or scope expansion — it does NOT recapitulate

**Common failures**:
- Opening with literature ("Prior research has shown...")
- Opening with methods ("Using 59,021 records...")
- Gap statement that says "more research is needed" without specifying what kind
- Closing paragraph that summarizes ("In this paper, we examined how...")

---

## Assessment Specifications

### Level 1: Knowledge Recognition

**Format**: Multiple choice + short answer (~30-45 min)

**Sample questions**:

1. Which paragraph opening is strongest for a theory section?
   - a) "Barley (1990) argued that technology shapes organizational structure."
   - b) "Technology and organizational structure have a complex, mutually constitutive relationship."
   - c) "In this section, we review the literature on technology and organizations."
   - d) "Several scholars have studied how technology affects work."

   **Correct**: b. It is a claim, not a citation, not a description of what the section does, and not vague.

2. Identify the citation function in each sentence:
   - "Organizations must acquire new technologies to survive and grow (Henderson & Clark, 1990; Tushman & Anderson, 1986; Abernathy & Clark, 1985)." → **Consensus-building**
   - "Thompson (1967) distinguishes three forms of interdependence, each with different coordination requirements." → **Author-in-prose engagement (steelman)**
   - "Prior research on technology and organizing does not provide much insight into how organizations manage this technological portfolio problem." → **Showing absence (gap)**

3. This paragraph has a transition problem. Identify it and fix it:
   > "Surveillance scholars have documented a quantitative increase in surveillance over the past several decades. Organizations face accountability pressures from many stakeholders simultaneously."

   **Problem**: No conceptual link between paragraphs. The first paragraph's key concept (surveillance increase) is abandoned; the second introduces a new topic (accountability) without connection.

4. What is wrong with this discussion closing?
   > "In this paper, we examined how organizations manage technological portfolios. We found that resource allocation is a key mechanism. These findings contribute to the literature on technology management."

   **Answer**: It is a summary, not a zoom-out or paradox restatement. It recapitulates rather than expanding. The final sentence uses the empty phrase "contribute to the literature" without saying what the contribution changes.

**Passing threshold**: ≥80%

### Level 2: Application with Feedback

**Format**: Construct arguments from provided materials (~2-4 hours)

**Materials provided**:
- A research puzzle description (phenomenon + theoretical context)
- Key citations with 1-sentence summaries
- A core finding with supporting evidence

**Tasks**:
1. Write an introduction section (4-5 paragraphs) following the WORLD → PROBLEM → GAP → QUESTION → PREVIEW arc
2. Given 3 jumbled paragraphs from a theory section, identify the correct order and explain why (using transition mechanics)
3. Write a contribution paragraph for a discussion section following the literature anchor → contrast → mechanism → implication pattern
4. Label the citation function of every citation in a provided 2-paragraph excerpt

**Evaluation rubric**:

| Criterion | Points |
|-----------|--------|
| Introduction follows WORLD → PROBLEM → GAP → QUESTION → PREVIEW arc | 20 |
| Paragraph topic sentences are claims (not citations or descriptions) | 15 |
| Transitions use lexical repetition + conceptual escalation | 15 |
| Citation deployment uses at least 3 of 4 functions appropriately | 15 |
| Gap statement is specific about process/mechanism | 10 |
| Paragraph ordering is correct with sound rationale | 15 |
| Contribution paragraph follows the four-move pattern | 10 |

**Passing threshold**: ≥70 points

**Feedback provided**:
- Annotated introduction with paragraph-level notes on arc, transitions, and citation function
- Comparison to expert construction of the same introduction
- Specific rewrites of weak transitions and topic sentences

---

### Level 3: Authentic Performance

**Format**: Independent argument construction (~4-8 hours)

**Materials provided**:
- A new puzzle, new finding, new theoretical context
- Raw literature summaries (not pre-organized into streams)
- Target journal

**Tasks**:
1. Write a complete introduction section (1500-2000 words)
2. Write a theory section outline with the first paragraph of each subsection fully written
3. Write the first two contribution paragraphs of a discussion section
4. Write the closing paragraph of the paper

**Evaluation criteria**:

| Criterion | Points |
|-----------|--------|
| Introduction arc is complete and coherent (WORLD → GAP → QUESTION → PREVIEW) | 25 |
| Paragraph architecture: every paragraph has claim topic sentence, evidence, clincher | 20 |
| Transitions: lexical threading visible, "The Turn" lands cleanly | 15 |
| Citation deployment: functions identified and appropriate per section | 15 |
| Theory section: organized by one of the three logics, consensus-then-complicate visible | 10 |
| Contributions: literature-anchored, not findings-recited | 10 |
| Closing paragraph: zoom-out or paradox restatement, NOT summary | 5 |

**Passing threshold**: ≥70 points total, no criterion below 50%

## Common Misconceptions

**"Good writing is about style and voice"**
Style matters, but argument construction is about structure. A beautifully written paragraph that opens with a citation and has no clincher is still a structurally weak paragraph. Structure first, style second.

**"I should cite everything I've read"**
Citations are tools with specific structural functions. Every citation cluster should serve one of the four functions (consensus, steelman, absence, tension). If you can't name the function, cut the citation.

**"The introduction should review the literature"**
The introduction should build a puzzle. Literature appears in service of the puzzle — establishing consensus, building the steelman, showing the absence. A comprehensive literature review belongs in the theory section, and even there it should be strategic, not exhaustive.

**"The discussion should summarize my findings"**
The discussion should make contributions — claims about what the findings change in our theoretical understanding. Each contribution paragraph starts with existing literature, not with "I found that..."

**"Transitions are about transition words"**
"Furthermore" is not a transition. A real transition threads a concept from one paragraph's clincher into the next paragraph's topic sentence. The connection should be conceptual, not just grammatical.

**"More citations = more credible"**
Volume signals consensus when used deliberately (3-6 stacked parenthetical citations). But 15+ citations after a single claim signals insecurity. The reader starts wondering why you need so much backup for one point.

## Readings & Resources

### Required
- 5 exemplar papers from your target journal — read mechanically (how is the introduction constructed? where is "The Turn"? what do the transitions do?)
- Sword, Helen (2012), *Stylish Academic Writing* — Chapters 1-4 on sentence and paragraph structure

### Recommended
- Barley (2006), "When I Write My Masterpiece" — On the craft of paper construction
- Weick (1989), "Theory Construction as Disciplined Imagination"
- Davis (1971), "That's Interesting!" — On what makes academic claims compelling
- Zuckerman (2008), "Tips for Article-Writers" — 10 criteria for academic framing (connects to D4)

### Practice Exercise
Take any published paper in your target journal. Read only the first sentence of every paragraph in the introduction. Can you follow the argument? If yes, the transitions work. If no, identify where the thread breaks.

---

## Self-Assessment Questions

Before taking the Level 3 assessment, you should be able to:

1. Identify the topic sentence, evidence, and clincher in any paragraph from a published paper
2. Name the citation function (consensus, steelman, absence, tension) for any citation cluster
3. Locate "The Turn" in any introduction — the single sentence where the argument pivots
4. Write 3 paragraphs where the first sentence of each paragraph threads the concept from the previous paragraph's clincher
5. Write a gap statement that specifies a missing mechanism/process, not just "more research needed"
6. Write a closing paragraph that does NOT summarize the paper

---

## Open Questions

These are genuine questions for faculty discussion:

1. **Should this be assessed separately?** Every domain's Level 3 already requires written work. Do domain assessments cover argument construction implicitly, or does it need standalone assessment to ensure students develop these skills before tackling domain-specific writing?

2. **Bootcamp or integrated?** Is argument construction better taught as a standalone workshop before domain work begins (like a writing bootcamp), or integrated into each domain's assessment feedback cycle?

3. **Does this belong in quals at all?** Perhaps argument construction is more naturally a Theory-Forge enforcement concern — the tool catches violations regardless of whether the student has been formally assessed. Is formal assessment necessary, or is real-time feedback during drafting sufficient?

4. **How do we handle students who write well already?** Some students arrive with strong writing mechanics from prior training or natural ability. What does "testing out" look like for a foundational skill? Is it just Level 3 with no prerequisites?

5. **Is this discipline-specific?** These patterns were extracted from organizational studies papers in ASQ, Organization Science, ASR, and AMJ. How much would change for other traditions (economics, psychology, humanities)? Is argument construction universal, or are we teaching a genre convention?

6. **What about non-English writers?** Argument construction mechanics may be harder for students writing in a second language. Should the assessment account for this, and if so, how?
