# Domain 2: Theoretical Positioning

## What This Domain Tests

The ability to situate a finding within theory—identifying what it violates, what would explain it, and who would care.

**Source in TheoryForge**: `/find-theory`, `/find-lens`, Zuckerman criteria

## Why It Matters

A finding without theory is a fact, not a contribution. Expert researchers automatically think: "What does this violate? What explains it? Who's the audience?" Novices often skip this entirely, treating "here's a pattern" as sufficient.

This domain tests whether you understand the difference between **finding something** and **contributing something**.

## Core Competencies

### 2.1 Theory Violation Identification
Recognizing when a finding contradicts established theoretical predictions.

**What it looks like**:
- "Resource dependence theory predicts X, but we see Y"
- "The standard model says A→B, but our data shows A→C under these conditions"
- "This finding is interesting because it violates the assumption that..."

**Common failures**:
- Not knowing what theories make predictions about your phenomenon
- Treating any finding as equally interesting regardless of theoretical implications
- Framing as "gap in literature" instead of "puzzle for theory"

### 2.2 Audience Awareness (Row vs Column)
Understanding that different academic communities care about different things.

**What it looks like**:
- "This is a theory paper—the contribution is extending [Theory X]"
- "This is a phenomenon paper—the contribution is understanding [Phenomenon Y]"
- "This audience cares about mechanisms; that audience cares about boundary conditions"

**Zuckerman's distinction**:
- **Row audiences**: Care about the phenomenon (e.g., entrepreneurship scholars, automation researchers)
- **Column audiences**: Care about the theory (e.g., institutional theorists, learning scholars)

**Common failures**:
- Trying to please both audiences (results in pleasing neither)
- Misidentifying your natural audience
- Using theory language for a row paper or phenomenon language for a column paper

### 2.3 Sensitizing Literature Selection
Finding the "second literature" that explains heterogeneity in your finding.

**What it looks like**:
- "Primary theory predicts X. But why does X only happen for some people?"
- "The literature on [Factor Y] explains who responds differently"
- "My contribution bridges [Primary Theory] and [Sensitizing Literature]"

**The pattern**:
1. Main theory makes a prediction
2. Your finding violates it (or shows heterogeneity)
3. You find a literature that explains WHEN the violation occurs
4. Your contribution is the bridge

**Common failures**:
- Using sensitizing literature as decoration, not explanation
- Choosing literature because it's popular, not because it explains your heterogeneity
- Never articulating the bridge—just citing two literatures side by side

### 2.4 Contribution Articulation
Stating clearly what the paper adds to knowledge.

**What it looks like**:
- "We extend [Theory] by showing it doesn't hold when [Condition]"
- "We identify [Mechanism] as the explanation for [Puzzle]"
- "We show that [Factor] moderates the [Theory] relationship"

**Common failures**:
- "We contribute to the literature by examining..."—this says nothing
- Listing 3 contributions that are actually one contribution stated three ways
- Contribution is implicit (reader has to figure it out)

## Assessment Specifications

### Level 1: Knowledge Recognition

**Format**: Multiple choice + matching + short answer

**Sample questions**:

1. Which of the following is a "puzzle in the world" framing vs a "gap in the literature" framing?
   - a) "Prior research has not examined how automation affects worker learning" (gap)
   - b) "Workers in automated facilities learn faster than theory predicts—why?" (puzzle)

   **Correct**: b is puzzle, a is gap. The puzzle is more compelling.

2. A researcher finds that incentive pay increases effort for some workers but decreases it for others. What should they do next?
   - a) Report the average effect
   - b) Search for a sensitizing literature that explains who responds positively vs negatively
   - c) Drop the workers who don't fit the hypothesis
   - d) Conclude that incentive pay doesn't work

   **Correct**: b. The heterogeneity is the story—find what explains it.

3. Match the audience type to the appropriate framing:

   | Framing | Audience |
   |---------|----------|
   | "This extends self-determination theory by..." | Column (theory) |
   | "This helps us understand why entrepreneurs..." | Row (phenomenon) |

4. Which of these is a well-articulated contribution?
   - a) "This paper contributes to the literature on organizational learning"
   - b) "We show that organizational learning declines under automation, but only when workers lack task autonomy—extending situated learning theory to human-machine contexts"
   - c) "We examine automation and learning"

   **Correct**: b. It's specific about what's shown, when it applies, and what theory is extended.

**Passing threshold**: ≥80%

### Level 2: Application with Feedback

**Format**: Given a finding, position it theoretically

**Materials provided**:
- A robust empirical finding (from anonymized data)
- Descriptive statistics and key results
- Research context

**Task**:
1. Identify which established theory this finding violates or extends (with citations)
2. Identify your primary audience (row or column) and explain why
3. Propose a sensitizing literature that explains heterogeneity (if present) or deepens the mechanism
4. Write a 1-paragraph contribution statement

**Evaluation rubric**:

| Criterion | Expert behavior | Points |
|-----------|-----------------|--------|
| Correctly identifies violated/extended theory | Knows the literature | 25 |
| Appropriate audience identification with rationale | Strategic thinking | 20 |
| Sensitizing literature is explanatory (not decorative) | Understands bridging | 30 |
| Contribution statement is specific and compelling | Can articulate value | 25 |

**Passing threshold**: ≥70 points

**Feedback provided**:
- Expert's theoretical positioning (comparison)
- Why expert chose different/same theory
- Assessment of contribution statement against Zuckerman criteria
- Specific suggestions for improvement

### Level 3: Authentic Performance

**Format**: Independent theoretical positioning of novel finding

**Materials provided**:
- New finding (not used in Level 2)
- Data context
- No hints about which literature applies

**Task**: Same as Level 2, evaluated against expert baseline

**Evaluation criteria**:

1. **Theory Identification** (35 points)
   - Is the identified theory appropriate?
   - Does the finding actually violate/extend it?
   - Are citations to foundational work included?

2. **Strategic Positioning** (35 points)
   - Is the audience identification correct?
   - Does the sensitizing literature actually explain heterogeneity?
   - Is there a clear bridge between literatures?

3. **Contribution Quality** (30 points)
   - Zuckerman criteria 4 (frame around DV): ≥3/5
   - Zuckerman criteria 5 (puzzle in world): ≥3/5
   - Zuckerman criteria 7 (compelling null): ≥3/5

**Passing threshold**: ≥70 points total; must score ≥25 on both Theory Identification and Strategic Positioning

## The Zuckerman Criteria (Reference)

This domain teaches the foundations of Zuckerman's framework. Key criteria for this domain:

1. **Motivate the paper**: Why should readers care?
2. **Know your audience**: Row or column?
3. **Substantive motivation**: About explaining the world, not tribal preferences
4. **Frame around DV**: Start with the question, not your answer
5. **Puzzle in world**: Real puzzle, not literature gap
7. **Compelling null**: What smart people believed before you showed otherwise

## Common Misconceptions

**"Any theory that relates to my variables works"**
No. The theory must make a prediction your finding violates or extends. Tangential citation isn't positioning.

**"I can appeal to both theory and phenomenon audiences"**
Rarely. Choose one. Trying to please both usually pleases neither and confuses reviewers.

**"My contribution is that I studied X in context Y"**
That's not a contribution. A contribution changes what we know or believe. New context alone doesn't do this unless it reveals something unexpected.

**"The sensitizing literature is the second theory I cite"**
Only if it explains your heterogeneity. Many papers cite two literatures without bridging them—the bridge is the contribution.

## Self-Assessment Questions

Before taking the Level 3 assessment, you should be able to answer:

1. Given a finding, what's your process for identifying which theory it violates?
2. How do you decide between row and column positioning?
3. What makes a sensitizing literature choice good vs decorative?
4. Can you state your last paper's contribution in one sentence without using "examine," "explore," or "investigate"?
5. What's the difference between "gap in literature" and "puzzle in the world"?

If you struggle with #5, you're definitely not ready.
