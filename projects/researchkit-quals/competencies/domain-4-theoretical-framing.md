# Domain 4: Theoretical Framing

## What This Domain Tests

The ability to generate multiple viable framings for the same finding, evaluate them systematically, and choose wisely.

**Source in TheoryForge**: `/smith-frames`, `/eval-zuckerman`

## Why It Matters

The same robust finding can become very different papers depending on framing. Expert researchers see multiple framings automatically; novices often see only one (usually the first that occurred to them).

Framing is where **taste** lives. You can't learn taste from a rubric—you develop it through practice, feedback, and exposure to good examples. This domain tests whether you've developed enough taste to choose framings well.

## Core Competencies

### 4.1 Multiple Framing Generation
Seeing several ways to frame the same finding—not just your first idea.

**What it looks like**:
- "Here are 3 ways to frame this: as an extension of [Theory A], as a boundary condition for [Theory B], or as a new mechanism for [Phenomenon C]"
- "The same finding could target organization theorists, labor economists, or practitioners—each would be a different paper"
- "I can lead with the puzzle, the paradox, or the phenomenon"

**Common failures**:
- Only seeing one framing (the one you thought of first)
- Generating "different" framings that are actually the same idea with different words
- Thinking one framing is obviously correct without considering alternatives

### 4.2 Framing Evaluation
Systematically assessing framings on novelty, robustness, coherence, and fit.

**What it looks like**:
- "Framing A is more novel but the evidence for it is weaker"
- "Framing B fits the journal better but the contribution is smaller"
- "Framing C has the best coherence—puzzle, theory, and findings align"

**Evaluation dimensions**:
- **Novelty**: Is this framing new? Does it add to what's known?
- **Robustness**: Does the finding actually support this framing?
- **Coherence**: Does the frame hold together logically?
- **Fit**: Does it match the target journal's genre and audience?

**Common failures**:
- Evaluating only on novelty (ignoring whether evidence supports it)
- Not considering journal fit until late in the process
- Confusing "I like this framing" with "this framing is strong"

### 4.3 Anticipating Counter-Arguments
Knowing what reviewers will push back on and preparing for it.

**What it looks like**:
- "A hostile R2 would say [X]—here's how we handle it"
- "The weakest claim in this framing is [Y]—we should acknowledge it"
- "Alternative interpretation [Z] is plausible—we need to address it directly"

**Common failures**:
- Being surprised by reviewer objections (you should have anticipated them)
- Ignoring weaknesses hoping reviewers won't notice (they will)
- Defensive responses instead of genuine engagement with alternatives

### 4.4 Hook and Contribution Crafting
Writing opening sentences and contribution statements that compel readers.

**What it looks like**:
- Hook grabs attention with puzzle/paradox/surprise
- Contribution statement is specific, not vague
- Abstract tells a complete story in 150 words
- Title signals the contribution memorably

**Common failures**:
- Opening with literature ("Prior research has shown...") instead of puzzle
- Contribution statement uses empty verbs ("examines," "explores," "investigates")
- Abstract is methods-heavy, contribution-light
- Title is descriptive ("A Study of X") not contributive ("How X Changes Y")

## Assessment Specifications

### Level 1: Knowledge Recognition

**Format**: Multiple choice + evaluation exercises

**Sample questions**:

1. Which of these is the best hook for an ASQ paper?
   - a) "Prior research has not examined how automation affects skill development"
   - b) "We examine the relationship between automation and worker learning"
   - c) "Workers in automated facilities learn faster than workers in traditional facilities—despite having less practice time"
   - d) "This paper contributes to the literature on workplace technology"

   **Correct**: c. It's a puzzle that surprises and makes readers want to know why.

2. A framing has high novelty but weak evidence support. What should you do?
   - a) Pursue it anyway—novelty is most important
   - b) Find more data to strengthen the evidence
   - c) Consider a less novel framing that the evidence actually supports
   - d) Emphasize novelty in the writing to compensate for weak evidence

   **Correct**: c. You can't publish what your data doesn't support, no matter how novel.

3. Evaluate this contribution statement: "We contribute to the literature on organizational learning by examining how automation affects skill development in warehouse settings."
   - What's wrong with it?
   - Write a better version.

   **Correct assessment**: Uses weak verb "examining," doesn't state what was found or why it matters. Better: "We show that automation accelerates skill development—but only when workers retain task autonomy—extending situated learning theory to human-machine work contexts."

4. Which evaluation dimension matters most for a Management Science submission?
   - a) Novelty
   - b) Robustness
   - c) Coherence
   - d) All equally

   **Correct**: b (primarily). ManSci emphasizes empirical rigor; a robust finding with moderate novelty beats a novel claim with weak evidence.

**Passing threshold**: ≥80%

### Level 2: Application with Feedback

**Format**: Generate and evaluate framings for a provided finding

**Materials provided**:
- A robust finding with theoretical context
- Mechanism evidence from qualitative data
- Primary and sensitizing literature summaries
- Target journal (ASQ, Organization Science, or ManSci)

**Task**:
1. Generate 3 distinct framings for the finding
2. For each framing, provide:
   - Title (2 options)
   - Hook (opening paragraph)
   - Contribution statement (1 paragraph)
   - Evaluation: Novelty, Robustness, Coherence, Fit (1-5 scale with rationale)
   - Counter-arguments and how you'd address them
3. Recommend one framing and explain why

**Evaluation rubric**:

| Criterion | Expert behavior | Points |
|-----------|-----------------|--------|
| Generated 3 genuinely distinct framings | Sees multiple angles | 20 |
| Hooks create puzzle/surprise (not lit review) | Knows what compels | 20 |
| Contribution statements are specific | Can articulate value | 15 |
| Evaluation is honest about weaknesses | Self-aware | 20 |
| Counter-arguments are legitimate (not straw men) | Anticipates review | 15 |
| Recommendation has sound rationale | Makes good choices | 10 |

**Passing threshold**: ≥70 points

**Feedback provided**:
- Expert's framings compared to student's
- Assessment of each framing against Zuckerman criteria
- Why expert would/wouldn't choose student's recommendation
- Specific line edits on hooks and contribution statements

---

### Level 3: Authentic Performance

**Format**: Independent framing of novel finding

**Materials provided**:
- New finding with data summary
- New theoretical context
- Target journal
- NO example framings

**Task**: Same as Level 2

**Evaluation criteria**:

1. **Framing Diversity** (25 points)
   - Are framings genuinely distinct?
   - Do they vary on meaningful dimensions (theory, audience, contribution type)?

2. **Zuckerman Compliance** (35 points)
   - Each framing evaluated on Zuckerman criteria 1-5, 7
   - Must achieve average ≥3.5/5 across framings
   - No framing below 2.5/5 on any criterion

3. **Adversarial Readiness** (20 points)
   - Counter-arguments are real threats (not straw men)
   - Responses are substantive (not dismissive)
   - Weakest claim in each framing is identified

4. **Recommendation Quality** (20 points)
   - Rationale connects to evaluation criteria
   - Tradeoffs are acknowledged
   - Choice is defensible (expert might choose differently but student's choice is reasonable)

**Passing threshold**: ≥70 points total; must achieve ≥25 on Zuckerman Compliance

## The Zuckerman Criteria (Full Reference)

This domain applies the full Zuckerman framework:

1. **Motivate the paper**: Introduction must be exciting
2. **Know your audience**: Row (phenomenon) or column (theory)?
3. **Substantive motivation**: About explaining the world, not tribal preferences
4. **Frame around DV**: Start with question/puzzle, not answer
5. **Puzzle in world**: Real puzzle, not literature gap
6. **Few hypotheses**: One idea people will remember
7. **Compelling null**: What smart people believed before
8. **Save the null**: When is the null right? Your contribution is the boundary
9. **Orient the reader**: Narrative arc from puzzle to finding
10. **No lit reviews**: Review to show what's compelling-but-flawed, not comprehensively

---

## Common Misconceptions

**"My first framing is usually right"**
It's usually not. The first framing is often the most obvious, not the most compelling. Force yourself to generate alternatives.

**"Different framings = different titles"**
No. Genuinely different framings target different audiences, foreground different theories, and make different contributions. Different words for the same idea isn't multiple framings.

**"I should pick the most novel framing"**
You should pick the framing your evidence actually supports. Reviewers won't accept novel claims with weak evidence.

**"Counter-arguments are things to minimize"**
They're things to engage with seriously. Reviewers respect papers that acknowledge limitations honestly.

**"Good framing is about writing style"**
It's about strategic positioning. Clear writing helps, but the right framing beats beautiful prose about the wrong angle.

## Self-Assessment Questions

Before taking the Level 3 assessment, you should be able to:

1. Generate 3+ framings for any finding in 30 minutes
2. Evaluate each framing on novelty, robustness, coherence, fit—and articulate tradeoffs
3. Anticipate the top 3 reviewer objections to any framing
4. Write a hook that creates puzzle/surprise in 2-3 sentences
5. Write a contribution statement without using "examine," "explore," or "investigate"

This domain takes most students the longest. Taste doesn't develop quickly.
