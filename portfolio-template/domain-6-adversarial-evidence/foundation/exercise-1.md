# Exercise 1: Identifying Disconfirming Evidence

## Context

The best researchers actively seek evidence that could prove them wrong. This exercise develops your ability to identify what would disconfirm a claim.

## The Concept

**Disconfirming evidence** is evidence that, if found, would:
- Contradict your hypothesis
- Challenge your interpretation
- Undermine your theory
- Suggest an alternative explanation

Actively seeking disconfirming evidence is what separates good science from confirmation bias.
