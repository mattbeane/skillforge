# Domain 6 Mastery Assessment: Adversarial Evidence

## Overview

Demonstrate mastery of adversarial thinking by systematically attacking and strengthening a research argument.

**Time:** 90 minutes
**Format:** Full adversarial analysis + argument reconstruction

---

## The Challenge

Below is a paper summary. Your job is to:
1. Systematically attack it as a hostile reviewer
2. Identify what would need to be true for the argument to hold
3. Strengthen the argument by integrating counter-evidence

## The Paper

**Title:** "The Automation Paradox: How AI Tools Accelerate Task Completion While Slowing Expertise Development"

**Abstract:**
> We investigate the effects of AI assistance on professional learning through a multi-method study in the accounting profession. Using data from 2,000 audit engagements and 50 in-depth interviews, we document an "automation paradox": while AI tools increased audit efficiency by 35%, auditors who used AI extensively showed significantly lower performance on complex judgment tasks after 3 years compared to auditors who used AI sparingly. Qualitative analysis reveals that AI tools allow professionals to complete tasks without developing the tacit knowledge traditionally acquired through struggle and failure. We theorize that "productive struggle"—the cognitive effort required to solve difficult problems—is essential for expertise development, and that AI tools can inadvertently short-circuit this process. Our findings have important implications for professional training and the design of AI-augmented work systems.

**Attack 2:** (On the qualitative findings)

The weakness:

Evidence that would expose this weakness:

Damage if weakness is real:

---

**Attack 3:** (On the integration of methods)

The weakness:

Evidence that would expose this weakness:

Damage if weakness is real:

---

### Theoretical Attacks

**Attack 4:** (On "productive struggle" as mechanism)

The weakness:

Alternative mechanism that explains the same findings:

How to test between them:

---

**Attack 5:** (On the policy implication)

The weakness:

Counter-argument:

Evidence for the counter-argument:

---

### The Killer Review

Write a 400-word hostile review that would likely lead to rejection.

**[YOUR KILLER REVIEW]**

---

## Part 2: Defense Requirements (20 min)

### What Would Need to Be True

For this paper's argument to be valid, what must be true?

| Assumption | What would test it | What if it's false |
|------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| 1. | | |
| 2. | | |
| 3. | | |
| 4. | | |
| 5. | | |

### The Pivotal Test

**What is the single most important test the authors should run?**

The test:

What result would confirm their argument:

What result would falsify their argument:

## Part 3: Counter-Evidence Integration (25 min)

### Evidence Against the Authors

What evidence AGAINST this paper exists (or likely exists)?

**Counter-evidence 1:**

What it is:

Where to find it:

How it challenges the paper:

---

**Counter-evidence 2:**

What it is:

Where to find it:

How it challenges the paper:

---

**Counter-evidence 3:**

What it is:

Where to find it:

How it challenges the paper:

---

### Strengthening Through Integration

Now help the authors. How could they integrate this counter-evidence to make a STRONGER argument?

**Strategy 1:** (Acknowledge and bound)

---

**Strategy 2:** (Explain away)

---

**Strategy 3:** (Incorporate into theory)

---

### Revised Abstract

Rewrite the abstract to create a stronger, more defensible argument that acknowledges counter-evidence.

**[YOUR REVISED ABSTRACT - 200 words]**

---

## Part 4: Meta-Reflection (15 min)

### Adversarial Process Assessment

**What was the most damaging attack you made?**

**Which attack was hardest to construct?**

**Did the adversarial process change your view of the paper?**

---

### Your Adversarial Tendencies

**Are you a natural attacker or defender?**

**What's your blind spot in adversarial thinking?**

**How will you build adversarial habits into your research process?**

## Evaluation Criteria

### Passing (Mastery Badge Earned)

| Criterion | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| Attack quality | Attacks are genuinely threatening, not superficial |
| Methodological sophistication | Identifies non-obvious methodological issues |
| Theoretical engagement | Proposes viable alternative mechanisms |
| Killer review | Would actually be concerning to authors |
| Integration skill | Shows how to strengthen argument with counter-evidence |
| Meta-awareness | Honest reflection on adversarial process |

### Excellence Indicators

- Attacks reveal issues the authors likely missed
- Alternative mechanisms are creative and plausible
- Killer review is specific and actionable
- Revised abstract is genuinely stronger, not just hedged
- Meta-reflection shows sophisticated understanding of adversarial thinking
- Can articulate specific practices for building adversarial habits

### Failure Modes

- Surface-level attacks that are easy to dismiss
- Failure to identify alternative explanations
- Killer review that's aggressive but not substantive
- Can't constructively integrate counter-evidence
- Defensive rather than curious stance
- Unable to strengthen argument through adversarial process

## Submission

Complete all sections. Your work should demonstrate:
1. Ability to attack your own (or others') work systematically
2. Sophisticated methodological and theoretical reasoning
3. Skill in identifying what would falsify an argument
4. Ability to strengthen arguments through adversarial process
5. Meta-awareness of your adversarial tendencies

---

## After Assessment

Regardless of outcome:
- Would you want someone to do this to your paper before submission?
- How will you build adversarial thinking into your process?
- What's the difference between adversarial and hostile?
