# Exercise 1: The Adversarial Collaborator

## Context

The best research teams include someone who tries to disprove the team's conclusions. This exercise develops your ability to be that adversarial collaborator—for yourself.

## The Setup

You've written a paper draft. Below is the abstract. Your job is to be your own harshest critic.

---

**Your Paper's Abstract:**

> This paper examines the long-term effects of AI assistance on professional skill development. Drawing on a two-year longitudinal study of 500 software developers across 10 companies, we find that developers who relied heavily on AI coding assistants experienced faster initial productivity gains but showed steeper skill decline when AI was unavailable. Qualitative interviews reveal a mechanism we term "cognitive offloading"—the gradual transfer of mental processes to AI systems, resulting in atrophied human capabilities. We contribute to the learning literature by identifying conditions under which technological aids can undermine the very skills they're designed to augment. Our findings suggest organizations face a fundamental tradeoff between short-term productivity and long-term capability development.

### Step 2: Write the Devastating Review

Write a 300-word review from a hostile Reviewer 2 who thinks this paper should be rejected.

**[YOUR REVIEWER 2 REVIEW]**

### Step 3: Write the Honest Response

Now respond to your own review as the author—but honestly. Don't be defensive.

**Response to major criticism 1:**

<!-- Acknowledge what's valid, explain what you can defend -->

---

<!-- Acknowledge what's valid, explain what you can defend -->

---

**Response to major criticism 3:**

<!-- Acknowledge what's valid, explain what you can defend -->

---

### Step 4: Revise Based on Attacks

What changes would you make to the paper based on this adversarial process?

**Data collection changes:**

**Analysis changes:**

**Framing changes:**

**Claims calibration:**
