# Domain 6 Practice Assessment: Adversarial Evidence

## Overview

Demonstrate ability to systematically search for and integrate counter-evidence.

**Time:** 60 minutes
**Format:** Counter-evidence search + claim revision

---

## The Challenge

You have developed the following finding and interpretation:

> **Finding:** In a study of 150 medical residents, those who regularly used AI diagnostic tools showed faster diagnosis speed but made more errors when AI was unavailable compared to residents who used AI rarely.
>
> **Interpretation:** AI tools create "skill atrophy"—the degradation of cognitive abilities due to lack of practice. Organizations should limit AI tool use during training to preserve skill development.

Your job: Try to disprove yourself.

## Part 1: Decomposition (10 min)

Break down your finding and interpretation into testable claims.

**Claim 1:** (The basic finding)

**Claim 2:** (The causal interpretation)

**Claim 3:** (The mechanism—skill atrophy)

**Claim 4:** (The policy recommendation)

---

## Part 2: Counter-Evidence Search (25 min)

For each claim, systematically search for counter-evidence.

### Claim 1 Counter-Evidence

**What evidence would disconfirm this?**

**Where would you look?**

**What did/would you find?**

**Revised confidence (1-10):**

---

### Claim 2 Counter-Evidence

**What evidence would disconfirm this?**

**Where would you look?**

**What did/would you find?**

**Revised confidence (1-10):**

---

### Claim 3 Counter-Evidence

**What evidence would disconfirm this?**

**Where would you look?**

**What did/would you find?**

**Revised confidence (1-10):**

---

### Claim 4 Counter-Evidence

**What evidence would disconfirm this?**

**Where would you look?**

**What did/would you find?**

**Revised confidence (1-10):**

---

## Part 3: Alternative Explanations (10 min)

Name THREE alternative explanations for your finding (other than skill atrophy).

**Alternative 1:**

Explanation:

Evidence for it:

Why it might be better than your interpretation:

---

**Alternative 2:**

Explanation:

Evidence for it:

Why it might be better than your interpretation:

---

**Alternative 3:**

Explanation:

Evidence for it:

Why it might be better than your interpretation:

---

## Part 4: Integration (15 min)

### Honest Assessment

**Which part of your original claim is most vulnerable?**

**What's the single strongest counter-argument?**

**If you're wrong, what's the most likely way you're wrong?**

---

### Revised Interpretation

Write a revised interpretation that integrates what you learned from the counter-evidence search.

**Original interpretation:**

> AI tools create "skill atrophy"—the degradation of cognitive abilities due to lack of practice. Organizations should limit AI tool use during training to preserve skill development.

**Revised interpretation (150-200 words):**

### Remaining Confidence

After your counter-evidence search, how confident are you in:

| Element | Confidence (1-10) | Why |
|---------|-------------------|-----|
| The basic finding | | |
| Your causal interpretation | | |
| The mechanism | | |
| The policy recommendation | | |

## Evaluation Criteria

### Passing (Practice Badge Earned)

| Criterion | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| Decomposition | Breaks claim into distinct testable parts |
| Search rigor | Genuinely looks for counter-evidence |
| Alternative explanations | Identifies non-trivial alternatives |
| Integration | Revises claim based on search |
| Calibration | Confidence levels are justified |

### Excellence Indicators

- Finds genuinely threatening counter-evidence
- Alternatives are creative and plausible
- Revised interpretation is more nuanced, not just weaker
- Can articulate what would change their mind
- Shows intellectual courage in confronting disconfirmation

### Common Mistakes

- Token counter-evidence search (going through motions)
- Weak alternatives that are easy to dismiss
- Revision that just hedges without integrating insights
- Unchanged confidence despite finding counter-evidence
- Defending original claim instead of genuinely testing it
