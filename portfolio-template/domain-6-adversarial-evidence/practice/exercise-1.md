# Exercise 1: The Pre-Mortem

## Context

A "pre-mortem" imagines that your project has failed, then works backward to understand why. This exercise applies pre-mortem thinking to research.

## The Scenario

Imagine it's two years from now. You submitted a paper and it was rejected from three journals. The reviewers all said the same thing: your evidence doesn't support your claims.

Your paper argued:

> "AI assistance during training accelerates skill acquisition but produces more brittle expertise."

You had data from 200 trainees, interviews with 30 professionals, and experiments showing faster learning with AI.

**The paper failed.** Now figure out why.

## Your Task

### Step 1: Catalog the Failures

List every way your evidence could have been insufficient.

**Quantitative Evidence Failures:**

1. Sample size/power issues:

2. Measurement validity issues:

3. Alternative explanations:

4. Missing controls:

5. Time horizon issues:

---

**Qualitative Evidence Failures:**

1. Sampling issues:

2. Interpretation issues:

3. Saturation issues:

4. Alternative readings:

---

**Integration Failures:**

1. Qual and quant don't align:

2. Claims exceed evidence:

3. Mechanisms aren't tested:

---

### Step 2: Rank the Failures

Which failure modes are most likely to have sunk your paper?

| Rank | Failure Mode | Why Most Likely |
|------|--------------|-----------------|
| 1 | | |
| 2 | | |
| 3 | | |
| 4 | | |
| 5 | | |

---

### Step 3: Prevention Strategies

For each top-ranked failure, how could you have prevented it?

**Failure 1 prevention:**

Data collection change:

Analysis change:

Claims calibration:

---

**Failure 2 prevention:**

Data collection change:

Analysis change:

Claims calibration:

---

**Failure 3 prevention:**

Data collection change:

Analysis change:

Claims calibration:

---

### Step 4: The Killer Question

**What is the single most devastating question a reviewer could ask about your evidence?**

The question:

Your honest answer:

What you should have done:

---

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] Cataloged failures across evidence types
- [ ] Ranked failures by likelihood
- [ ] Proposed specific prevention strategies
- [ ] Identified the killer question
- [ ] Honestly assessed vulnerabilities

## Reflection

Pre-mortems require imagining your own failure. Why is this psychologically hard? How do you make yourself do it?
