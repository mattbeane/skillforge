# Exercise 2: Active Counter-Evidence Search

## Context

Most researchers look for evidence that supports their claims. This exercise develops your ability to systematically search for counter-evidence.

## The Setup

You've just completed a study with this finding:

> "Teams that use AI writing tools produce higher-quality documents but develop weaker individual writing skills over time."

You believe this finding. But before you publish, you need to actively search for evidence that might contradict it.

## Your Task

### Step 1: Decompose the Claim

Break your claim into its component parts.

**Claim A:** Teams using AI writing tools produce higher-quality documents.

**Claim B:** Teams using AI writing tools develop weaker individual writing skills.

**Claim C:** There's a tradeoff between document quality and skill development.

---

### Step 2: Search for Counter-Evidence to Each Claim

**Against Claim A (AI tools → higher quality):**

What evidence would show AI tools DON'T improve document quality?

Where to search:

What you found (or would expect to find):

How this affects your confidence:

---

**Against Claim B (AI tools → weaker skills):**

What evidence would show AI tools DON'T weaken skills?

Where to search:

What you found (or would expect to find):

How this affects your confidence:

---

**Against Claim C (the tradeoff itself):**

What evidence would show there's no tradeoff?

Where to search:

What you found (or would expect to find):

How this affects your confidence:

### Step 3: Alternative Explanations

What else could explain your findings besides your interpretation?

**Alternative 1:**

The explanation:

Evidence for it:

How you'd rule it out:

---

**Alternative 2:**

The explanation:

Evidence for it:

How you'd rule it out:

---

**Alternative 3:**

The explanation:

Evidence for it:

How you'd rule it out:

---

### Step 4: Boundary Conditions

Even if your claim is true in general, when is it NOT true?

**Condition 1:** The claim might not hold when...

Why:

Evidence:

---

**Condition 2:** The claim might not hold when...

Why:

Evidence:

---

**Condition 3:** The claim might not hold when...

Why:

Evidence:

---

### Step 5: Updated Claim

Based on your counter-evidence search, how would you revise your original claim?

**Original claim:**

> "Teams that use AI writing tools produce higher-quality documents but develop weaker individual writing skills over time."

**Revised claim:**

> "[Your updated, more nuanced claim]"

**What changed and why:**

---

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] Decomposed the claim into parts
- [ ] Searched for counter-evidence to each part
- [ ] Identified alternative explanations
- [ ] Specified boundary conditions

## Reflection

Did searching for counter-evidence make your argument stronger or weaker? How?
