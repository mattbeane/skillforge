- Integrating disconfirming evidence to strengthen arguments

## How This Helps You Supervise AI

AI tends toward confirmation—it finds evidence for whatever you ask. It struggles to:
- Actively seek disconfirming evidence
- Build genuinely strong counter-arguments
- Recognize when to abandon a hypothesis
- Integrate counter-evidence constructively
- Maintain intellectual honesty under pressure

Adversarial thinking is what separates science from storytelling.
