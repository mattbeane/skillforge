## How This Works

1. **Complete exercises** in each domain folder
2. **Commit your work** with meaningful messages
3. **Request badge check** via `/skill-forge check <badge-id>`
4. **Earn verified badges** as git tags linked to your evidence

## Verification

All badges are verifiable. Click any badge link in [BADGES.md](BADGES.md) to see:
- When it was issued
- What commits contain the evidence
- The actual work you did

## Getting Started

```bash
# In Claude Code
/skill-forge status          # See your progress
/skill-forge next            # Get next recommended exercise
/skill-forge check d1-foundation  # Request badge verification
```
