# Domain 7: Claim Verification

Calibrating your claims to your evidence—no overclaiming, no underclaiming.

## Levels

### Foundation
*Can you identify when a claim exceeds its evidence?*

- **Exercise 1:** Claim-Evidence Alignment - Calibrate claim strength to evidence quality
- **Exercise 2:** Evidence Chain Construction - Trace and build logical evidence chains
- **Assessment:** Demonstrate claim calibration fundamentals

### Practice
*Can you calibrate claim strength to evidence quality?*

- **Exercise 1:** The Claims Audit - Systematically evaluate all claims in a paper
- **Exercise 2:** Building Robust Claim Chains - Construct arguments that survive scrutiny
- **Assessment:** Audit claims and build defensible arguments

### Mastery
*Can you build claim-evidence chains that survive hostile review?*

- **Exercise 1:** The Full Paper Audit - Comprehensive claims analysis
- **Assessment:** Audit, reconstruct, and defend calibrated claims

## Skills Developed

- Distinguishing observational, directional, and causal claims
- Calibrating language to evidence quality
- Tracing evidence chains from data to contribution
- Auditing papers for claim-evidence mismatches
- Building arguments that survive hostile review

## How This Helps You Supervise AI

AI often overclaims—it's trained to be confident and helpful. It struggles to:
- Calibrate claim strength to evidence quality
- Recognize when claims exceed what data support
- Build nuanced arguments with appropriate hedging
- Defend claims against hostile reviewers
- Balance contribution with honesty

You're the calibration layer that maintains scientific integrity.
