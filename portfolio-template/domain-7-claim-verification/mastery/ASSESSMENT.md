# Domain 7 Mastery Assessment: Claim Verification

## Overview

Demonstrate mastery by auditing a paper, reconstructing defensible claims, and building an argument that survives hostile review.

**Time:** 90 minutes
**Format:** Full audit + reconstruction + defense

## Part 1: Comprehensive Audit (35 min)

### The Paper

**Title:** "Learning by Not Doing: How AI Assistance Undermines Skill Acquisition in Professional Services"

**Abstract:**
> We examine how AI tools affect professional skill development using a natural experiment in the legal profession. When a major legal research platform introduced AI-powered case analysis in 2021, some law firms adopted immediately while others delayed adoption due to client concerns. Comparing associates at early-adopting versus late-adopting firms (n=450), we find that early adopters showed faster document production but scored lower on bar exam simulation exercises administered 18 months later. Qualitative interviews (n=40) reveal that associates at AI-forward firms describe "efficient but shallow" learning—they complete work faster but understand it less deeply. We theorize that AI tools short-circuit the "desirable difficulties" essential for expertise development. Legal education and other professional training programs should incorporate AI-free learning zones to preserve deep skill acquisition.

**Key Findings:**
1. Early AI adopters produced documents 35% faster (p<.001)
2. Early adopters scored 12% lower on bar simulation (p<.05)
3. Interview themes: "efficient but shallow," "I don't really understand why"
4. Firm-level analysis shows no difference in client outcomes

### Task 2: Deep Audit of Three Critical Claims

**Critical Claim 1:** "AI tools short-circuit 'desirable difficulties'"

Evidence provided:

What evidence would you need:

Calibration assessment:

Reconstructed claim:

---

**Critical Claim 2:** "early adopters showed... lower scores on bar exam simulation"

Evidence provided:

Methodological concerns:

Alternative explanations:

Reconstructed claim:

---

**Critical Claim 3:** "professional training programs should incorporate AI-free learning zones"

Evidence provided:

Logical gap:

What would justify this claim:

Reconstructed claim (or rejection):

---

### Task 3: Write the Hostile Review

Write a 300-word review focusing specifically on claim-evidence issues.

**[YOUR CLAIM-FOCUSED REVIEW]**

---

## Part 2: Reconstruction (30 min)

### Task 4: Build Defensible Claims

Using the same findings, construct defensible claims that preserve contribution.

**Defensible empirical claim:**

Evidence:

Language choices that ensure calibration:

---

**Defensible interpretive claim:**

Evidence:

Appropriate hedging:

---

**Defensible theoretical claim (if any):**

Evidence and reasoning:

Boundary statement:

---

**Defensible practical implication (if any):**

Evidence:

Appropriate limitations:

---

### Task 5: Reconstructed Abstract

Write a 200-word abstract that makes only defensible claims while preserving meaningful contribution.

**[YOUR RECONSTRUCTED ABSTRACT]**

---

### Task 6: Compare

| Dimension | Original | Reconstructed |
|-----------|----------|---------------|
| Strength of causal claim | | |
| Scope of generalization | | |
| Theoretical ambition | | |
| Practical guidance | | |
| Likely reviewer response | | |
| Long-term credibility | | |

---

## Part 3: Defense (25 min)

### Scenario

You've submitted your reconstructed version. A reviewer pushes back:

> "Your claims are now so hedged they're trivial. 'AI adoption is associated with faster performance but may relate to reduced scores on simulations' tells us nothing actionable. You've sucked all the contribution out of the paper. Either make a real claim or don't publish."

---

### Task 7: Response to Reviewer

Write a 250-word response defending your calibrated claims.

**[YOUR RESPONSE]**

---

### Task 8: When to Claim Boldly

**When is it appropriate to make claims beyond what the evidence strictly supports?**

**What safeguards should accompany bold claims?**

**Where is the line between bold and overclaimed?**

---

## Evaluation Criteria

### Passing (Mastery Badge Earned)

| Criterion | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| Comprehensive audit | Identifies all major claims |
| Accurate calibration | Correctly assesses claim-evidence match |
| Deep analysis | Identifies subtle overclaiming, not just obvious |
| Reconstruction skill | Preserves contribution while fixing calibration |
| Defense quality | Can defend calibrated claims against pushback |
| Meta-understanding | Articulates when bold claims are appropriate |

### Excellence Indicators

- Catches non-obvious inferential leaps
- Reconstruction is genuinely publishable
- Response to reviewer is persuasive
- Demonstrates sophisticated understanding of claim calibration as rhetorical skill
- Can articulate field-specific norms around claiming

### Failure Modes

- Misses major overclaiming
- Reconstruction strips all contribution
- Unable to defend calibrated claims
- Treats all hedging as equal (doesn't distinguish appropriate from excessive)
- Cannot articulate when bold claims are appropriate

---

## Submission

Complete all sections. Your work should demonstrate:
1. Systematic claim auditing skill
2. Accurate calibration assessment
3. Ability to reconstruct defensible arguments
4. Skill in defending appropriate claims
5. Meta-understanding of claiming as scholarly practice

---

## After Assessment

Regardless of outcome:
- How will you audit your own claims before submission?
- What norms around claiming exist in your field?
- Where do you personally tend toward over- or under-claiming?
