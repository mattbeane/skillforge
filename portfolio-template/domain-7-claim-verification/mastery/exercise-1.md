# Exercise 1: The Full Paper Audit

## Context

Published papers in top journals still contain claim-evidence mismatches. This exercise develops your ability to audit a complete paper's claims.

## The Setup

Below is a condensed paper. Conduct a full claims audit.

## The Paper

**Title:** "The Delegation Dilemma: How AI Assistance Shapes Professional Judgment Development"

**Abstract:**
> This paper investigates how AI assistance affects the development of professional judgment in knowledge work. Using a longitudinal study of 800 junior accountants across 15 firms, combined with 60 in-depth interviews, we find that AI-assisted accountants demonstrate superior technical accuracy but weaker professional judgment after three years compared to their peers. Our analysis reveals a mechanism we term "judgment outsourcing"—the gradual transfer of evaluative decisions to AI systems. We contribute to theories of expertise development by showing that mastery requires not just correct answers but the struggle of arriving at them. Organizations face a fundamental tradeoff: AI tools that boost short-term performance may undermine long-term capability development.

**Method:**
> We tracked 800 junior accountants from their first day (2020) through year three (2023). Half worked in "AI-forward" firms (treatment) that mandated AI tool usage; half in "traditional" firms (control) that prohibited AI tools. We measured: (1) technical accuracy via standardized tests, (2) professional judgment via case-based assessments with expert evaluation, and (3) career progression. We also conducted 60 interviews (30 per group).

**Results:**
> AI-forward accountants scored 23% higher on technical accuracy (p<.001) but 18% lower on professional judgment assessments (p<.01). The judgment gap widened each year. Interview data revealed that AI-forward accountants described feeling "confident but uncertain"—they knew they produced accurate work but felt unable to explain why something was correct without AI verification.

**Discussion:**
> These findings demonstrate that AI tools create a judgment deficit that traditional training avoids. The mechanism is judgment outsourcing: when AI provides the answer, professionals skip the cognitive work that builds evaluative capacity. This has profound implications for how we train the next generation of knowledge workers. Firms should implement "AI sabbaticals" during training to ensure judgment development.

### Step 3: Audit Summary

| Claim Category | Count | Assessment |
|----------------|-------|------------|
| Well-supported empirical claims | | |
| Interpretive leaps | | |
| Unsupported theoretical claims | | |
| Prescriptive claims beyond evidence | | |

### Step 4: Rewrite the Abstract

Write a 150-word abstract that makes only defensible claims.

**[YOUR CALIBRATED ABSTRACT]**

---

### Step 5: What's Lost?

**What contribution is lost when you calibrate the claims?**

**Is the paper still publishable? Why or why not?**

**What additional evidence would support the stronger claims?**

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] Extracted all major claims
- [ ] Mapped evidence to each claim
- [ ] Assessed calibration for each
- [ ] Identified biggest problems
- [ ] Wrote calibrated alternative
- [ ] Reflected on tradeoffs

## Reflection

Is it possible to make a significant theoretical contribution without overclaiming? How?
