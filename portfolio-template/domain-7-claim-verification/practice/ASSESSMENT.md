# Domain 7 Practice Assessment: Claim Verification

## Overview

Demonstrate ability to audit claims and build robust evidence chains.

**Time:** 60 minutes
**Format:** Claim audit + argument construction

## Part 1: Claim Audit (30 min)

### The Text

Audit the following abstract for claim calibration.

> **Abstract:** This study examines the impact of generative AI on creative work. Through a randomized experiment with 400 graphic designers, we found that designers using AI tools produced 50% more design variants (p<.001) and received higher quality ratings from blind reviewers (mean difference = 0.8 points on 10-point scale, p<.01). Follow-up interviews with 30 participants revealed that designers felt "freed from routine work" and able to "focus on the creative parts."
>
> These results demonstrate that AI augments rather than replaces human creativity. By automating routine aspects of design, AI tools enable professionals to allocate more cognitive resources to truly creative endeavors. Organizations should accelerate AI adoption to boost creative output. However, we caution that over-reliance on AI suggestions may lead to homogenization of creative work over time.

### Task 1: Identify All Claims

List every claim (minimum 6).

| # | Claim | Type |
|---|-------|------|
| 1 | | |
| 2 | | |
| 3 | | |
| 4 | | |
| 5 | | |
| 6 | | |
| 7 | | |
| 8 | | |

---

### Task 2: Evaluate Calibration

For each claim, evaluate calibration.

| Claim # | Evidence | Calibration | Issue |
|---------|----------|-------------|-------|
| 1 | | Over/Under/OK | |
| 2 | | | |
| 3 | | | |
| 4 | | | |
| 5 | | | |
| 6 | | | |

**Problematic Claim 2:**

**Problematic Claim 3:**

## Part 2: Argument Construction (30 min)

### The Data

You have conducted a study with these findings:

**Finding 1:** In a survey of 500 consultants, 72% report that they "use AI tools regularly" in their work.

**Finding 2:** Consultants who use AI regularly bill 15% more hours on average than those who don't (controlling for experience and firm).

**Finding 3:** In interviews, consultants describe AI as helping them "work on more projects simultaneously" and "reduce research time."

**Finding 4:** Partners at consulting firms estimate that junior consultants are "less prepared for unstructured problems" than 5 years ago.

### Task 4: Construct a Defensible Argument

Build an argument chain from these findings.

**Step 1: What can you claim from each finding?**

Finding 1 claim:

Finding 2 claim:

Finding 3 claim:

Finding 4 claim:

---

**Step 2: What interpretation connects them?**

Your interpretation:

Evidence that supports it:

Alternative interpretation:

Why your interpretation is better (or why both might be valid):

---

**Step 3: Write a calibrated contribution statement (100-150 words)**

Your contribution:

---

**Step 4: Stress test your argument**

**Weakest link:**

**How a hostile reviewer would attack:**

**Your defense:**

## Evaluation Criteria

### Passing (Practice Badge Earned)

| Criterion | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| Claim identification | Identifies all major claims |
| Calibration assessment | Correctly evaluates over/under/calibrated |
| Recalibration quality | Better versions are appropriately calibrated |
| Argument construction | Builds logical chain from evidence |
| Appropriate hedging | Claims match evidence strength |
| Stress test awareness | Identifies vulnerabilities |

### Excellence Indicators

- Catches subtle overclaiming (not just obvious cases)
- Recalibrations preserve contribution while fixing calibration
- Argument construction is creative yet defensible
- Stress test reveals genuine insight into argument weaknesses
- Can articulate why calibration matters for scientific credibility

### Common Mistakes

- Missing interpretive leaps as claims
- "Fixing" overclaiming by adding vague hedges
- Building arguments with unsupported interpretive jumps
- Not recognizing prescriptive claims as claims
- Stress test that doesn't actually stress the argument
