# Exercise 2: Building Robust Claim Chains

## Context

Reviewers attack weak links in your argument. This exercise develops your ability to build claims that survive scrutiny.

## The Setup

You have the following findings from a study on AI and learning:

**Quantitative Findings:**
- Engineers using AI assistants completed debugging tasks 40% faster (n=200, p<.001)
- After 6 months, the AI group's unassisted performance was 15% lower than the control group (p<.05)
- Effect was stronger for junior engineers (β=-.25) than senior engineers (β=-.08)

**Qualitative Findings:**
- 28/35 interviewees reported "relying on AI" for tasks they "used to do manually"
- Common phrase: "I don't need to remember that—the AI knows it"
- Several seniors expressed concern about juniors not "learning the fundamentals"

## Your Task

### Step 1: Establish What You Can Claim

For each finding, what claim can you make?

**Quantitative Finding 1 (40% faster):**

Strongest defensible claim:

What would be overclaiming:

---

**Quantitative Finding 2 (15% lower unassisted):**

Strongest defensible claim:

What would be overclaiming:

---

**Quantitative Finding 3 (differential effect):**

Strongest defensible claim:

What would be overclaiming:

---

**Qualitative Finding 1 (28/35 relying):**

Strongest defensible claim:

What would be overclaiming:

---

**Qualitative Finding 2 ("AI knows it"):**

Strongest defensible claim:

What would be overclaiming:

---

### Step 2: Build the Main Argument

Now construct your main argument, linking findings to a theoretical contribution.

**Data-level claim (what you observed):**

Supporting evidence:

Potential attacks:

Your defense:

---

**Pattern-level claim (what the data pattern suggests):**

Supporting evidence:

Potential attacks:

Your defense:

---

**Mechanism-level claim (why this happens):**

Supporting evidence:

Potential attacks:

Your defense:

---

**Theoretical-level claim (what this means for theory):**

Supporting evidence:

Potential attacks:

Your defense:

---

**Practical-level claim (what organizations should do):**

Supporting evidence:

Potential attacks:

Your defense:

---

### Step 3: Write the Contribution Paragraph

Write a 150-200 word contribution paragraph that makes claims calibrated to your evidence.

**[YOUR CONTRIBUTION PARAGRAPH]**

---

### Step 4: Stress Test

Have each claim in your paragraph survived these tests?

| Test | Passed? | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| Is the claim supported by specific evidence? | | |
| Is the language calibrated (no overclaiming)? | | |
| Are alternative explanations addressed? | | |
| Are limitations acknowledged? | | |
| Would Reviewer 2 attack this? | | |

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] Established defensible claims for all findings
- [ ] Built multi-level argument chain
- [ ] Anticipated attacks at each level
- [ ] Wrote calibrated contribution paragraph
- [ ] Stress tested all claims

## Reflection

What's the relationship between caution in claims and impact of contribution? How do you balance them?
