# Exercise 1: The Claims Audit

## Context

Every paper makes multiple claims. Some are well-supported, some aren't. This exercise develops your ability to systematically audit claims.

## The Setup

Below is an excerpt from a paper's findings and discussion. Audit every claim.

---

**Paper Excerpt:**

> Our results demonstrate several important findings regarding AI tool adoption and professional skill development. First, professionals who adopted AI tools early showed significantly higher productivity (β=.32, p<.001), confirming that AI enhances performance. Second, longitudinal analysis revealed that heavy AI users experienced skill decline over time, particularly in complex problem-solving tasks. This suggests that AI creates a "use it or lose it" dynamic for human skills.
>
> Interviews with 45 professionals revealed that many felt their judgment had become "lazy" due to AI reliance. One manager noted, "I don't think as hard anymore because I know the AI will catch my mistakes." This pattern was particularly pronounced among younger professionals, indicating that AI may have differential effects based on career stage.
>
> These findings contribute to our understanding of the automation paradox—the counterintuitive finding that labor-saving technologies can sometimes undermine the very capabilities they're designed to support. Organizations should carefully consider how AI tools are deployed during training and should implement "AI-free zones" to preserve skill development.
