# Exercise 1: Claim-Evidence Alignment

## Context

Academic writing requires claims that match evidence—no overclaiming, no underclaiming. This exercise develops your ability to calibrate claim strength to evidence quality.

## The Concept

Claims exist on a continuum from weak to strong:

| Claim Type | Language | Evidence Required |
|------------|----------|-------------------|
| Observational | "is associated with" | Correlation |
| Directional | "predicts", "leads to" | Correlation + theory |
| Causal | "causes", "affects" | Experimental or quasi-experimental |
| Universal | "always", "never" | Comprehensive evidence |

## Your Task

### Part 1: Claim Classification

For each claim below, identify (a) the claim strength and (b) what evidence would be needed.

---

**Claim 1:** "AI assistance improves coding speed."

Claim strength: [ ] Observational [ ] Directional [ ] Causal [ ] Universal

Evidence needed to support this claim:

Is this claim calibrated to typical evidence? Why or why not?

---

**Claim 2:** "Teams with higher psychological safety tend to have more innovation."

Claim strength: [ ] Observational [ ] Directional [ ] Causal [ ] Universal

Evidence needed to support this claim:

Is this claim calibrated to typical evidence? Why or why not?

---

**Claim 3:** "Feedback causes performance improvement."

Claim strength: [ ] Observational [ ] Directional [ ] Causal [ ] Universal

Evidence needed to support this claim:

Is this claim calibrated to typical evidence? Why or why not?

---

**Claim 4:** "Remote workers are always less collaborative than in-office workers."

Claim strength: [ ] Observational [ ] Directional [ ] Causal [ ] Universal

Evidence needed to support this claim:

Is this claim calibrated to typical evidence? Why or why not?

---

**Claim 5:** "Diversity is positively associated with team performance in our sample."

Claim strength: [ ] Observational [ ] Directional [ ] Causal [ ] Universal

Evidence needed to support this claim:

Is this claim calibrated to typical evidence? Why or why not?

### Part 2: Recalibration Practice

Rewrite each overclaimed or underclaimed statement to match the evidence described.

---

**Statement:** "Mentoring causes career success."
**Evidence:** Survey of 500 professionals showing that those with mentors earn 20% more on average.

Recalibrated claim:

---

**Statement:** "There may be some association between training and performance."
**Evidence:** Randomized controlled trial showing training group performed 35% better (p<.001).

Recalibrated claim:

---

**Statement:** "AI tools always reduce learning."
**Evidence:** Study of 100 developers showing those using AI learned syntax faster but design patterns slower.

Recalibrated claim:

---

**Statement:** "Psychological safety is correlated with innovation."
**Evidence:** Longitudinal study with instrumental variables showing psychological safety predicts innovation 2 years later, controlling for prior innovation.

Recalibrated claim:

---

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] Correctly classified all claim strengths
- [ ] Identified evidence requirements for each
- [ ] Recognized calibration issues
- [ ] Successfully recalibrated all statements

## Reflection

What's harder: avoiding overclaiming or avoiding underclaiming? Why?
