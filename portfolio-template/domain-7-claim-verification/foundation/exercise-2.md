# Exercise 2: Evidence Chain Construction

## Context

Strong arguments have clear chains from evidence to claims. This exercise develops your ability to trace and construct these chains.

## The Concept

An evidence chain links:
1. **Raw data** → What you observed
2. **Analyzed findings** → What patterns emerged
3. **Interpretation** → What the patterns mean
4. **Claim** → What you're asserting
5. **Contribution** → Why it matters

Each link must be justified.

## Your Task

### Part 1: Trace the Chain

For the argument below, trace the evidence chain and identify any weak links.

---

**The Argument:**

> "Our analysis of 300 GitHub repositories shows that projects using AI coding assistants have 25% more commits per contributor (p<.01). This suggests that AI tools increase developer productivity. Organizations should therefore adopt AI coding assistants to improve their software development output."

---

**Raw data:**

<!-- What did they actually observe? -->

---

**Analyzed finding:**

<!-- What statistical pattern emerged? -->

**Potential weak link?** [ ] Yes [ ] No

If yes, explain:

---

**Interpretation:**

<!-- What meaning did they assign to the pattern? -->

**Potential weak link?** [ ] Yes [ ] No

If yes, explain:

---

**Claim:**

<!-- What are they asserting? -->

**Potential weak link?** [ ] Yes [ ] No

If yes, explain:

---

**Contribution:**

<!-- What practical implication do they draw? -->

**Potential weak link?** [ ] Yes [ ] No

If yes, explain:

---

**Weakest link in the chain:**

<!-- Which transition is most problematic? -->

**How to strengthen it:**

<!-- What additional evidence or reasoning would help? -->

---

### Part 2: Build Your Own Chain

Construct an evidence chain for the following raw data.

**Raw data:** In interviews with 25 consultants, 20 mentioned that they "Google things" they used to ask senior partners about.

---

**Analyzed finding:**

<!-- How would you summarize this pattern? -->

---

**Interpretation:**

<!-- What does this pattern mean? -->

---

**Claim:**

<!-- What claim can you make based on this? -->

---

**Contribution:**

<!-- Why does this matter? -->

---

**Check your chain:**

| Link | Justified? | Reasoning |
|------|------------|-----------|
| Data → Finding | | |
| Finding → Interpretation | | |
| Interpretation → Claim | | |
| Claim → Contribution | | |

---

### Part 3: Identify Broken Chains

For each example, identify where the evidence chain breaks.

---

**Example 1:**

> "Survey respondents rated their managers highly on 'gives feedback' items. Therefore, feedback improves performance."

Where does the chain break?

What's missing?

---

**Example 2:**

> "In experiments, diverse teams performed better. Organizations should hire for diversity."

Where does the chain break?

What's missing?

---

**Example 3:**

> "We found a strong correlation between AI use and productivity. AI use does not harm productivity."

Where does the chain break?

What's missing?

---

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] Traced the chain in Part 1
- [ ] Identified weak links
- [ ] Built a justified chain in Part 2
- [ ] Identified breaks in all Part 3 examples

## Reflection

When reading papers, do you naturally trace evidence chains? How will you build this habit?
