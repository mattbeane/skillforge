# Domain 7 Foundation Assessment: Claim Verification

## Overview

Demonstrate ability to calibrate claims to evidence and trace evidence chains.

**Time:** 30 minutes
**Format:** Written assessment

## Part 1: Claim Calibration (15 min)

### Question 1

For each claim, rate whether it is OVERCLAIMED, UNDERCLAIMED, or CALIBRATED relative to the evidence described.

---

**Claim:** "AI assistance causes faster task completion."
**Evidence:** Observational study showing developers using AI complete tasks 20% faster on average.

[ ] Overclaimed
[ ] Underclaimed
[ ] Calibrated

Explanation (one sentence):

---

**Claim:** "There appears to be some positive relationship between training and performance."
**Evidence:** Randomized experiment with 500 participants showing training group performed 40% better (p<.001).

[ ] Overclaimed
[ ] Underclaimed
[ ] Calibrated

Explanation (one sentence):

---

**Claim:** "Psychological safety is associated with higher team performance in high-tech industries."
**Evidence:** Survey of 200 teams in Silicon Valley showing r=.35 between psychological safety and self-reported performance.

[ ] Overclaimed
[ ] Underclaimed
[ ] Calibrated

Explanation (one sentence):

---

### Question 2

Rewrite this overclaimed statement to match the evidence.

**Original:** "Diverse teams always outperform homogeneous teams."
**Evidence:** Meta-analysis of 50 studies showing diverse teams perform slightly better on complex tasks (d=.15) but slightly worse on routine tasks (d=-.10).

**Recalibrated claim:**

## Part 2: Evidence Chains (15 min)

### Question 3

Trace the evidence chain in this argument and identify the weakest link.

> "Our regression analysis shows that employees who report using AI tools have higher performance ratings (β=.25, p<.01). This demonstrates that AI tools improve performance. Companies should invest in AI tool adoption."

**Data:**

**Finding:**

**Interpretation:**

**Claim:**

**Contribution:**

**Weakest link:**

**Why it's weak:**

---

### Question 4

Given this data, construct an appropriate evidence chain.

**Raw data:** In a longitudinal study, 70% of workers who received AI training reported feeling "more confident" in their jobs 6 months later, compared to 45% of workers who didn't receive training.

**Appropriate finding:**

**Appropriate interpretation:**

**Appropriate claim:**

**What claim would be overclaiming:**

## Evaluation Criteria

### Passing (Foundation Badge Earned)

| Criterion | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| Calibration detection | Correctly identifies overclaiming/underclaiming |
| Recalibration | Can rewrite claims to match evidence |
| Chain tracing | Identifies links in evidence chains |
| Weak link detection | Correctly identifies where chains break |
| Chain construction | Can build appropriate chains from data |

### Common Mistakes

- Confusing correlation with causation
- Missing selection bias in "overclaim" detection
- Building chains where interpretation exceeds data
- Recalibrating by just adding hedges ("may", "might")
