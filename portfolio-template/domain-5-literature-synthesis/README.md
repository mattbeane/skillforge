# Domain 5: Literature Synthesis

Mastering the art of synthesizing scholarly conversations rather than just summarizing papers.

## Levels

### Foundation
*Can you map debates and trace conceptual evolution?*

- **Exercise 1:** Mapping a Theoretical Debate - Identify camps and underlying disagreements
- **Exercise 2:** Tracing Conceptual Evolution - Understand how concepts change over time
- **Assessment:** Demonstrate literature mapping skills

### Practice
*Can you build citation networks and write synthetically?*

- **Exercise 1:** Building a Citation Network - Map relationships between key papers
- **Exercise 2:** Writing a Synthetic Literature Review - Produce a publishable lit review section
- **Assessment:** Write a literature review that synthesizes, not summarizes

### Mastery
*Can you synthesize across disciplinary boundaries?*

- **Exercise 1:** Cross-Disciplinary Synthesis - Combine insights from fields that don't talk
- **Assessment:** Write a publication-quality cross-disciplinary review

## Skills Developed

- Mapping scholarly debates and identifying camps
- Tracing how concepts evolve over time
- Building and interpreting citation networks
- Writing synthetically rather than serially
- Integrating insights across disciplinary boundaries

## How This Helps You Supervise AI

AI can summarize papers and identify citations, but it struggles to:
- Understand what scholars are really arguing about
- See how the same concept means different things in different contexts
- Identify genuine gaps vs. pseudo-gaps
- Synthesize across disciplinary boundaries
- Write literature reviews that tell a story, not list summaries

Synthesis requires understanding, not just processing.
