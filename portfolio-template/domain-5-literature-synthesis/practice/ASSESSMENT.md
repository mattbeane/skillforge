**Time:** 60 minutes
**Format:** Written literature review section

---

## The Challenge

Write a literature review section (800-1000 words) for a paper investigating:

> "How does algorithmic management affect worker autonomy and skill development?"

Your review should:
1. Establish what's known
2. Show the debate/disagreement
3. Identify the gap
4. Set up your contribution

## Part 1: Planning (15 min)

### Concept Definition

**What is "algorithmic management"?**

**What are "worker autonomy" and "skill development" in this context?**

---

### Literature Mapping

**Which literatures must you draw from?** (Name at least 3)

1.
2.
3.

---

### Debate Identification

**What do scholars disagree about in this space?**

Position A:

Position B:

---

### Gap Identification

**What hasn't been studied or resolved?**

---

### Structural Plan

**Paragraph-by-paragraph outline:**

P1 (purpose + key cites):

P2 (purpose + key cites):

P3 (purpose + key cites):

P4 (purpose + key cites):

P5 (purpose + key cites):

---

## Part 2: Writing (35 min)

Write your literature review section below.

---

**[YOUR LITERATURE REVIEW - 800-1000 WORDS]**

---

## Part 3: Meta-Commentary (10 min)

### Strategic Choices

**Why did you structure it this way?**

**What papers did you choose NOT to cite, and why?**

**Where did you have to simplify or gloss over nuance?**

---

### Self-Assessment

**What's the strongest aspect of this review?**

**What would a reviewer likely critique?**

**What would make this review publishable vs. merely acceptable?**

## Evaluation Criteria

### Passing (Practice Badge Earned)

| Criterion | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| Synthesis | Not a list of paper summaries |
| Structure | Clear organizing logic |
| Debate | Shows genuine intellectual tension |
| Citations | Real papers, accurately characterized |
| Gap | Identifies specific gap that needs filling |
| Setup | Clearly sets up your paper's contribution |
| Meta-awareness | Can explain strategic choices |

### Excellence Indicators

- Review reads like published work
- Cites papers across disciplinary boundaries
- Shows evolution of thinking over time
- Gap is non-obvious but compelling
- Meta-commentary reveals sophisticated strategic thinking

### Common Mistakes

- Serial summaries ("Smith (2020) found... Jones (2021) found...")
- Ignoring debate (making literature seem unified when it isn't)
- Vague gap ("more research is needed")
- Strawman gap (no one cares about filling it)
- Too narrow or too broad scope
- No transition to your contribution

## Submission

Complete all sections. Your literature review should demonstrate:
1. Command of relevant scholarly conversations
2. Ability to synthesize, not just summarize
3. Strategic thinking about what to include/exclude
4. Clear path from what's known to what you'll contribute
