# Exercise 1: Building a Citation Network

## Context

Literature reviews aren't lists—they're maps. This exercise develops your ability to see relationships between papers.

## The Setup

You're writing a literature review on **AI and expertise** for a management journal. You need to understand how key papers connect.

## Your Task

### Step 1: Identify Foundational Papers

List 5 foundational papers that any review on AI and expertise should cite. For each:

**Paper 1:**

Citation:

Core contribution:

Why it's foundational:

---

**Paper 2:**

Citation:

Core contribution:

Why it's foundational:

---

**Paper 3:**

Citation:

Core contribution:

Why it's foundational:

---

**Paper 4:**

Citation:

Core contribution:

Why it's foundational:

---

**Paper 5:**

Citation:

Core contribution:

Why it's foundational:

---

### Step 2: Map the Citation Network

How do these papers cite each other? (Or don't?)

**Draw a citation map** (describe in words or ASCII):

<!-- Which paper cites which? -->

**What clusters do you see?**

<!-- Are there distinct groups that cite each other but not others? -->

**Who are the bridges?**

<!-- Papers or scholars that connect different clusters -->

---

### Step 3: Identify the Camps

Based on your citation network, what intellectual camps can you identify?

**Camp 1:**

Label:

Key papers:

Central argument:

Disciplinary home:

---

**Camp 2:**

Label:

Key papers:

Central argument:

Disciplinary home:

---

**Camp 3 (if applicable):**

Label:

Key papers:

Central argument:

Disciplinary home:

---

### Step 4: Find the Conversation Gaps

**What aren't they talking about?**

<!-- What topics are absent from these foundational papers? -->

**Who aren't they citing?**

<!-- What relevant work is being ignored? -->

**What's the opportunity?**

<!-- Where could a new paper make a contribution? -->

---

### Step 5: Your Positioning

If you were writing a paper on AI and expertise, how would you position yourself relative to these camps?

**Camp I would build on:**

**Camp I would challenge:**

**Gap I would fill:**

**My tentative contribution:**
