# Domain 5 Mastery Assessment: Literature Synthesis

## Overview

Write a publication-quality literature review that synthesizes multiple literatures and positions a novel contribution.

**Time:** 90 minutes
**Format:** Full literature review + strategic commentary

---

## The Challenge

Write a complete literature review section (1200-1500 words) for a paper on:

> "The organizational implications of human-AI teaming"

This paper will be submitted to **Organization Science** (a top management journal). Your review must:
1. Synthesize at least 3 distinct literatures
2. Show intellectual progress and debate
3. Identify a non-obvious gap
4. Make the reader believe your paper is necessary

## Part 1: Strategic Planning (20 min)

### Audience Analysis

**What does an Organization Science reader expect?**

**What theoretical conversations matter to this audience?**

**What would make them skeptical of a paper on human-AI teaming?**

---

### Literature Selection

**Which literatures will you draw from?**

| Literature | Key Concepts | Why Relevant |
|------------|--------------|--------------|
| 1. | | |
| 2. | | |
| 3. | | |
| 4. (optional) | | |

---

### Structural Strategy

**How will you organize the review?**

- [ ] By theoretical tradition
- [ ] By research question
- [ ] By chronology
- [ ] By debate/tension
- [ ] Other: __________

**Why this structure?**

---

### Gap Strategy

**What gap will you identify?**

**Why should readers care about this gap?**

**How does your paper fill it?**

---

**What's the risk of your positioning?**

---

### Quality Self-Assessment

| Dimension | Rating (1-5) | Justification |
|-----------|--------------|---------------|
| Synthesis (not summary) | | |
| Cross-literature integration | | |
| Shows debate/tension | | |
| Gap is compelling | | |
| Sets up contribution | | |
| Publication-ready quality | | |

---

### Improvement Plan

**If you could revise with unlimited time, what would you change?**

**What would a senior scholar add that you missed?**

---

## Evaluation Criteria

### Passing (Mastery Badge Earned)

| Criterion | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| Multi-literature synthesis | Draws from 3+ distinct literatures |
| Integration | Literatures speak to each other, not listed serially |
| Scholarly voice | Reads like Organization Science |
| Non-obvious gap | Gap isn't "more research needed" |
| Strategic citation | Key papers included, rationale for exclusions |
| Self-awareness | Honest assessment of weaknesses |

### Excellence Indicators

- Review could be submitted to a journal today
- Cross-disciplinary insights emerge from synthesis
- Gap makes reader want to read the paper
- Anticipates and preempts reviewer objections
- Strategic commentary shows sophisticated positioning

### Failure Modes

- Serial summaries masquerading as synthesis
- Forced connections between literatures
- Gap that no one cares about
- Missing essential foundational papers
- Unable to articulate strategic choices
- Doesn't sound like a top journal

---

## Submission

Complete all sections. Your literature review should demonstrate:
1. Command of multiple scholarly conversations
2. Ability to synthesize across boundaries
3. Strategic thinking about positioning
4. Publication-quality scholarly voice
5. Honest self-assessment

---

## After Assessment

Regardless of outcome:
- Would you actually submit this to Organization Science?
- What would you need to read to strengthen it?
- How would feedback from a senior scholar change it?
