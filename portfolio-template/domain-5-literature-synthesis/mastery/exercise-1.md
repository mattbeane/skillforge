# Exercise 1: Cross-Disciplinary Synthesis

## Context

Breakthrough insights often come from combining literatures that don't usually talk to each other. This exercise develops your ability to synthesize across disciplinary boundaries.

## The Challenge

You're writing a paper on **how organizations develop AI capabilities**. This topic touches multiple disciplines that rarely cite each other:

- **Strategy/Capabilities literature** (dynamic capabilities, resource-based view)
- **Computer science/ML literature** (technical implementation, ML ops)
- **Sociology/STS literature** (social shaping of technology, expertise)
- **Learning/HRD literature** (training, skill development)

## Your Task

### Step 1: Map Each Discipline's Perspective

**Strategy/Capabilities:**

What question do they ask about AI adoption?

Key concepts they use:

What they assume or take for granted:

What they ignore or can't see:

---

**Computer Science/ML:**

What question do they ask about AI adoption?

Key concepts they use:

What they assume or take for granted:

What they ignore or can't see:

---

**Sociology/STS:**

What question do they ask about AI adoption?

Key concepts they use:

---

**Learning/HRD:**

What question do they ask about AI adoption?

Key concepts they use:

What they assume or take for granted:

What they ignore or can't see:

### Step 2: Identify Cross-Disciplinary Tensions

What do these literatures disagree about (even implicitly)?

**Tension 1:**

<!-- Where do they contradict? -->

Which disciplines are in conflict?

What's at stake?

---

**Tension 2:**

Which disciplines are in conflict?

What's at stake?

---

**Tension 3:**

Which disciplines are in conflict?

What's at stake?

---

### Step 3: Find the Synthesis Opportunity

**What does combining these literatures reveal that no single discipline sees?**

<!-- The emergent insight -->

**How would you frame a paper that bridges them?**

<!-- Your integrative framing -->

**Which discipline would you "home" the paper in, and why?**

<!-- Primary audience -->

**How would you translate concepts across boundaries?**

<!-- Key translation moves -->

---

### Step 4: Draft the Cross-Disciplinary Introduction

Write a 300-400 word introduction that synthesizes insights from at least 3 of these disciplines and positions your contribution.

**[YOUR INTRODUCTION HERE]**

---

### Step 5: Anticipate Disciplinary Resistance

Each discipline will have objections to your synthesis.

**Strategy scholars will say:**

Your response:

---

**CS/ML scholars will say:**

Your response:

---

**Sociologists will say:**

Your response:

---

**Learning scholars will say:**

Your response:

---

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] Can translate concepts across boundaries

## Reflection

Cross-disciplinary work is risky—you might be seen as "not deep enough" by any single field. When is it worth it?
