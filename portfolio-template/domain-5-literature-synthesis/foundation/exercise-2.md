# Exercise 2: Tracing Conceptual Evolution

## Context

Concepts change over time. What a term means today isn't necessarily what it meant when introduced. This exercise develops your ability to trace conceptual evolution.

## The Concept

**Organizational Learning**

This is one of the most influential—and contested—concepts in management research.

## Your Task

### Step 1: Origins

**Who first introduced "organizational learning" as a scholarly concept?**

<!-- Name and approximate date -->

**What were they trying to explain?**

<!-- What phenomenon prompted the concept? -->

**How did they define it?**

<!-- The original definition -->

---

### Step 2: Early Development

As the concept spread, it changed. Map the early evolution.

**First major extension/revision:**

Scholar:

What they changed:

Why it mattered:

---

**Second major extension/revision:**

Scholar:

What they changed:

Why it mattered:

---

### Step 3: The Fragmentation

By the 1990s, "organizational learning" had split into multiple streams. Identify at least two distinct streams.

**Stream A:**

Name/label for this stream:

Key scholars:

How they define organizational learning:

What they study:

---

**Stream B:**

Name/label for this stream:

Key scholars:

How they define organizational learning:

What they study:

---

**What's the fundamental difference between these streams?**

<!-- What are they really disagreeing about? -->

---

### Step 4: Contemporary Status

**How is "organizational learning" used today?**

<!-- In recent papers -->

**Is it still a productive concept or has it become diluted?**

<!-- Your assessment -->

**What's replaced it, if anything?**

<!-- Related newer concepts -->
