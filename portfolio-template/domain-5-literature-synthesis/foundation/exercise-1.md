# Exercise 1: Mapping a Theoretical Debate

## Context

Academic literatures are conversations. This exercise develops your ability to hear the different voices and understand what they're arguing about.

## The Topic

**Psychological Safety in Teams**

This concept has become hugely popular in management research and practice. But scholars disagree about what it is, how it works, and whether it's always good.

## Your Task

### Step 1: Identify the Core Concept

**How would you define psychological safety to a non-academic?**

<!-- In your own words -->

**Who originated this concept?**

<!-- Key foundational scholar -->

**What problem was it originally trying to solve?**

<!-- What question did it answer? -->

---

### Step 2: Map the Debate

Different scholars take different positions on psychological safety. Map at least three distinct positions.

**Position A: The Enthusiasts**

Core claim:

Key scholars who represent this view:

Evidence they point to:

What they might be missing:

---

**Position B: The Skeptics**

Core claim:

Key scholars who represent this view:

Evidence they point to:

What they might be missing:

---

**Position C: The Contingency Theorists**

Core claim (it depends on what?):

Key scholars who represent this view:

What conditions do they emphasize?

What they might be missing:

---

### Step 3: Identify the Underlying Disagreements

These positions disagree about something deeper than just whether psychological safety is "good." What are the underlying disagreements?

**Disagreement 1: Definitional**

<!-- What is psychological safety, really? -->

**Disagreement 2: Causal**

<!-- What causes what? Which direction does the arrow point? -->

**Disagreement 3: Normative**

<!-- Is it always desirable? For whom? -->

---

### Step 4: Find the Opening

If you wanted to contribute to this literature, where would you enter?

**The gap I see:**

<!-- What's not being addressed? -->

**Why it matters:**

<!-- What hangs on filling this gap? -->

**How I would address it:**

<!-- Research approach -->
