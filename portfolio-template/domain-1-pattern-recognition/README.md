# Domain 1: Pattern Recognition & Data Sense

Developing intuition for distinguishing signal from noise in quantitative findings.

## Levels

### Foundation
*Can you distinguish meaningful patterns from noise?*

- **Exercise 1:** Pattern or Noise? - Learn to spot the difference between robust findings and statistical artifacts
- **Exercise 2:** Reading Robustness Tables - Interpret what happens when specifications change
- **Assessment:** Demonstrate pattern recognition fundamentals

### Practice
*Can you verify patterns through your own analysis?*

- **Exercise 1:** Run Your Own Robustness Checks - Conduct specification analysis
- **Exercise 2:** Heterogeneity Hunting - Look for who the effect works for
- **Assessment:** Verify patterns independently

### Mastery
*Can you make strategic decisions about which patterns to pursue?*

- **Exercise 1:** The Full Pattern Hunt - Navigate pattern discovery strategically
- **Assessment:** Demonstrate complete pattern recognition workflow

## Skills Developed

- Reading regression tables critically
- Understanding what robustness means (and doesn't mean)
- Recognizing when effects are fragile vs. robust
- Identifying heterogeneity that suggests mechanisms
- Making judgment calls about which patterns matter

## How This Helps You Supervise AI

AI tools can find patterns in data, but they struggle to:
- Distinguish meaningful from spurious patterns
- Assess whether patterns are robust to alternative specifications
- Judge when heterogeneity is substantively interesting
- Make strategic calls about which patterns to develop

These skills make you the quality gate.
