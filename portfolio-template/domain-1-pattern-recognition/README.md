# Domain 1: Pattern Recognition & Data Sense

The ability to identify robust empirical patterns that might support a paper—and equally important, to recognize when a pattern is noise.

## Levels

### Foundation
*Can you recognize patterns when shown them?*

Exercises focus on:
- Identifying patterns in pre-analyzed data
- Distinguishing signal from noise in examples
- Recognizing common statistical artifacts

### Practice
*Can you find patterns with guidance?*

Exercises focus on:
- Running basic pattern-hunting analyses
- Testing patterns against controls
- Interpreting robustness checks

### Mastery
*Can you find patterns independently and judge their quality?*

Exercises focus on:
- Designing pattern-hunting strategies
- Making kill/pursue decisions on findings
- Identifying heterogeneity worth exploring
