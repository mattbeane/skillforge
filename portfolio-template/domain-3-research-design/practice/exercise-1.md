# Exercise 1: Designing a Study

## Context

Moving from critique to creation. This exercise develops your ability to design a study that can answer a meaningful question.

## The Question

You want to answer:

> "Does receiving AI-generated feedback (vs. human feedback) affect how learners incorporate feedback into their work?"

You have access to a large online learning platform with 50,000+ active users.

## Your Task

### Step 1: Specify the Question

Before designing, sharpen the question.

**What is "AI-generated feedback"?**

<!-- Be precise -->

**What does "incorporate feedback" mean operationally?**

<!-- How would you measure this? -->

**What is your theoretical expectation?**

<!-- What do you think will happen, and why? -->

**Null hypothesis:**

<!-- What's the boring explanation you're trying to rule out? -->

---

### Step 2: Choose Your Design

**Primary design:**

- [ ] Lab experiment
- [ ] Field experiment (A/B test)
- [ ] Natural experiment
- [ ] Regression discontinuity
- [ ] Difference-in-differences
- [ ] Other: _______________

**Why this design?**

<!-- What makes it appropriate for this question and context? -->

**What's the treatment?**

<!-- What exactly varies between conditions? -->

**What's the comparison group?**

<!-- What's the counterfactual? -->

---

### Step 3: Define Your Measures

**Primary outcome variable:**

Name:

Operationalization:

Data source:

---

**Secondary outcome variables:**

1. Name:
   Operationalization:

2. Name:
   Operationalization:

---

**Control variables (if not randomizing):**

<!-- What do you need to hold constant? -->

---

### Step 4: Identify Threats

**Threat 1:**

<!-- What could confound your results? -->

How you'll address it:

---

**Threat 2:**

<!-- Another potential problem -->

How you'll address it:

---

**Threat 3:**

<!-- Think about measurement, selection, etc. -->

How you'll address it:

---

### Step 5: Practical Considerations

**Required sample size (rough estimate):**

<!-- How many participants do you need? -->

**Ethical considerations:**

<!-- What permissions/disclosures are needed? -->

**Timeline:**

<!-- How long will data collection take? -->

**What could go wrong?**

<!-- Murphy's law for research -->

---

### Step 6: Write the Methods Section Outline

Draft a 200-word methods section outline that covers:
- Participants
- Procedure
- Measures
- Analysis plan

**Your methods outline:**

---

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] Question is sharply specified
- [ ] Design matches the question
- [ ] Treatment and comparison are clearly defined
- [ ] Outcomes are measurable
- [ ] Major threats identified and addressed
- [ ] Practical constraints considered
- [ ] Methods outline is clear and complete

## Reflection

What was the hardest part of this design exercise? What would you need to learn more about?
