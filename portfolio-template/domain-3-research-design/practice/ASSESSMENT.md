# Domain 3 Practice Assessment: Research Design Intuition

## Overview

Design a study and defend your methodological choices.

**Time:** 60 minutes
**Format:** Design exercise + written defense

## The Challenge

You have been asked to evaluate this causal claim:

> "Hybrid work arrangements (2-3 days remote) lead to better work-life balance than fully in-office or fully remote arrangements."

A company with 5,000 employees has agreed to partner with you. They currently have all three arrangements across different teams, but assignment is not random—teams chose their own arrangements based on job requirements and manager preferences.

Design a study to evaluate this claim as rigorously as possible.

## Part 1: Design Specification (30 min)

### Research Question

**Precise research question:**

<!-- Sharpen the question -->

**What does "better work-life balance" mean operationally?**

<!-- How will you measure it? -->

---

### Design Choice

**Your chosen design:**

**Why this design given the constraints?**

<!-- Justify your choice -->

**What designs did you consider and reject?**

<!-- Show your thinking -->

---

### Sample and Data

**Who is in your sample?**

**What data will you collect?**

**What is your comparison strategy?**

<!-- How are you constructing counterfactuals? -->

---

### Measures

**Primary outcome:**

Measure:
Data source:
Validity considerations:

**Secondary outcomes (2-3):**

1.
2.
3.

**Key control variables:**

---

### Analysis Plan

**Primary analysis:**

<!-- What's your main test? -->

**Robustness checks:**

<!-- How will you verify results? -->

**Heterogeneity analysis:**

<!-- Does the effect vary? -->

---

## Part 2: Threat Assessment (15 min)

### Identification Problems

| Threat | Severity (1-5) | How You Address It |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|
| | | |
| | | |
| | | |
| | | |

### Honest Limitations

**What can you NOT conclude from this design?**

**What causal claim strength is appropriate?**

- [ ] Strong causal claim ("X causes Y")
- [ ] Moderate causal claim ("X is associated with Y, controlling for...")
- [ ] Suggestive evidence ("X predicts Y, but...")
- [ ] Descriptive only ("X correlates with Y")

## Part 3: Defense (15 min)

### Anticipated Reviewer Critiques

**Critique 1:** "Selection bias makes this uninterpretable."

Your response:

---

**Critique 2:** "Your measure of work-life balance is problematic."

Your response:

---

**Critique 3:** "You can't separate hybrid from other team differences."

Your response:

---

### Alternative Design Comparison

**If you had unlimited resources and cooperation, what would you do differently?**

**What would that gain you?**

**Why is your actual design still valuable?**

---

## Evaluation Criteria

### Passing (Practice Badge Earned)

| Criterion | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| Design coherence | Design matches question and constraints |
| Measure validity | Outcomes are meaningfully operationalized |
| Threat awareness | Major identification problems identified |
| Honest calibration | Claim strength matches design strength |
| Defense quality | Responds substantively to critiques |

### Excellence Indicators

- Innovative identification strategy within constraints
- Multiple robustness approaches planned
- Heterogeneity analysis is theoretically motivated
- Defense shows deep understanding of limitations
- Acknowledges what ideal design would look like

### Common Mistakes

- Proposing experiments when they're not feasible
- Ignoring selection into work arrangements
- Over-claiming from observational data
- Weak operationalization of "work-life balance"
- Not planning for alternative explanations
