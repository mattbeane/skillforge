# Exercise 2: Strengthening a Weak Design

## Context

Most studies you encounter (and initially design) have weaknesses. This exercise develops your ability to iteratively strengthen research designs.

## The Original Study

A researcher proposes:

> "I want to study whether having a mentor improves career outcomes. I'll survey 1,000 professionals, ask if they have a mentor, and compare the salaries and promotion rates of those with mentors vs. without. I'll control for education and years of experience."

## Your Task

### Step 1: Identify All the Problems

List every identification problem with this design.

**Problem 1:**

<!-- What's wrong? -->

**Problem 2:**

<!-- What's wrong? -->

**Problem 3:**

<!-- What's wrong? -->

**Problem 4:**

<!-- What else? -->

**Problem 5:**

<!-- Keep going -->

### Step 2: Rank the Problems

Which problems are most severe? Rank your problems from most to least damaging.

| Rank | Problem | Why It's Severe |
|------|---------|-----------------|
| 1 | | |
| 2 | | |
| 3 | | |
| 4 | | |
| 5 | | |

---

### Step 3: Propose Solutions

For each major problem, propose a solution within the constraints of observational data (assume you can't randomize mentor assignment).

**Problem 1 solution:**

<!-- How would you address it? -->

**Problem 2 solution:**

<!-- How would you address it? -->

**Problem 3 solution:**

<!-- How would you address it? -->

---

### Step 4: Design Iteration

Propose an improved design that addresses the top 3 problems. Stay observational.

**Improved Design:**

Sample:

Data collection:

Measures:

Analysis approach:

---

**What identification problems remain?**

<!-- Be honest -->

**How strong can your causal claim be now?**

<!-- Calibrate appropriately -->

---

### Step 5: The Nuclear Option

Now forget constraints. If you could run any study to answer "Does mentoring improve career outcomes?", what would it be?

**Ideal study design:**

<!-- Dream big -->

**Why isn't this feasible in practice?**

<!-- What makes it impractical? -->

**What's the best feasible approximation?**

<!-- Get as close as you can -->

## Iterative Improvement Map

Trace the evolution of the design:

```
Original Design
     ↓
Problem: [main issue]
     ↓
First Improvement: [what you changed]
     ↓
Remaining Problem: [what's still wrong]
     ↓
Second Improvement: [what you changed]
     ↓
Final Design Quality: [rate 1-10 and justify]
```

## Reflection

Research design is about tradeoffs. What's the most painful tradeoff you had to make in this exercise?
