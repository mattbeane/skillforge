# Domain 3: Research Design Intuition

Developing instincts for matching questions to methods and spotting identification problems.

## Levels

### Foundation
*Can you match questions to appropriate methods?*

- **Exercise 1:** Matching Questions to Methods - Learn which methods answer which questions
- **Exercise 2:** Spotting Identification Problems - Recognize threats to causal inference
- **Assessment:** Demonstrate design fundamentals

### Practice
*Can you design studies and strengthen weak designs?*

- **Exercise 1:** Designing a Study - Create a design from scratch
- **Exercise 2:** Strengthening a Weak Design - Iteratively improve a flawed design
- **Assessment:** Design a study within real-world constraints

### Mastery
*Can you design multi-method research programs?*

- **Exercise 1:** Multi-Method Design Integration - Integrate quant, qual, and theory
- **Assessment:** Design and defend a complete research program

## Skills Developed

- Matching research questions to appropriate methods
- Identifying threats to identification (selection, omitted variables, reverse causality)
- Designing studies within practical constraints
- Strengthening weak designs iteratively
- Integrating multiple methods into coherent programs

## How This Helps You Supervise AI

AI can run analyses and even suggest designs, but it struggles to:
- Understand what questions can and can't be answered with given data
- Spot subtle identification problems that invalidate conclusions
- Make practical tradeoffs between rigor and feasibility
- Design research programs (not just single studies)

You provide the methodological judgment AI lacks.
