## Part 1: Method Matching (15 min)

For each question, select the most appropriate primary method and briefly justify.

### Question A

> "Does mindfulness training reduce burnout among healthcare workers?"

**Best method:**

**One-sentence justification:**

**Key threat to address:**

---

### Question B

> "How do newcomers learn unwritten rules in organizations?"

**Best method:**

**One-sentence justification:**

**Key threat to address:**

---

### Question C

> "Did the 2017 tax reform affect corporate R&D spending?"

**Best method:**

**One-sentence justification:**

**Key threat to address:**

---

### Question D

> "What predicts which employees will leave within their first year?"

**Best method:**

**One-sentence justification:**

**Key threat to address:**

---

## Part 2: Identification Problems (15 min)

Read this study description and answer the questions below.

> **Study:** Researchers collected data on 200 software development teams. They measured "psychological safety" using a survey and "team productivity" using lines of code committed. They found a positive correlation (r = 0.45, p < .001) between psychological safety and productivity. They conclude: "Organizations should invest in psychological safety training because it causes higher productivity."

### Question 1

What is the primary identification problem with this claim?

**Your answer:**

---

### Question 2

Name ONE additional identification problem (different from Q1).

**Your answer:**

---

### Question 3

What research design would allow a stronger causal claim?

**Your answer:**

---

### Question 4

Even with your proposed design, what limitation would remain?

**Your answer:**

---

## Evaluation Criteria

### Passing (Foundation Badge Earned)

| Criterion | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| Method matching | Appropriate methods selected for at least 3/4 questions |
| Justifications | Justifications reference the nature of the research question |
| Problem identification | Correctly identifies primary problem in Part 2 |
| Design improvement | Proposed design genuinely addresses the identification problem |
| Limitation awareness | Acknowledges that even good designs have limits |

### Common Mistakes

- Suggesting experiments for questions that can't be experimentally tested
- Missing survivorship bias when only studying successes
- Thinking correlation + controls = causation
- Proposing designs that don't match practical constraints
