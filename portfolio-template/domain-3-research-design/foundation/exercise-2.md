# Exercise 2: Spotting Identification Problems

## Context

Every research design has threats to causal identification. This exercise trains you to spot them quickly.

## Your Task

For each study description, identify the main threat to causal inference.

---

### Study 1

> "We surveyed 500 managers and found that those who report higher 'growth mindset' scores also report higher team performance. We conclude that growth mindset improves team performance."

**The claim:**

<!-- What are they claiming? -->

**The main identification problem:**

- [ ] Reverse causality
- [ ] Omitted variable bias
- [ ] Selection bias
- [ ] Measurement error
- [ ] Simultaneity
- [ ] Survivorship bias

**Explain the problem:**

<!-- Why is this a threat to their claim? -->

**What would fix it?**

<!-- What design would address this? -->

---

### Study 2

> "We compared patent filings at companies that adopted AI tools to those that didn't. Companies with AI filed 40% more patents. We conclude that AI adoption increases innovation."

**The claim:**

<!-- What are they claiming? -->

**The main identification problem:**

- [ ] Reverse causality
- [ ] Omitted variable bias
- [ ] Selection bias
- [ ] Measurement error
- [ ] Simultaneity
- [ ] Survivorship bias

**Explain the problem:**

<!-- Why is this a threat to their claim? -->

**What would fix it?**

<!-- What design would address this? -->

---

### Study 3

> "We analyzed successful startups and found that 90% had founders who worked extremely long hours. We conclude that long working hours are key to startup success."

**The claim:**

<!-- What are they claiming? -->

**The main identification problem:**

- [ ] Reverse causality
- [ ] Omitted variable bias
- [ ] Selection bias
- [ ] Measurement error
- [ ] Simultaneity
- [ ] Survivorship bias

**Explain the problem:**

<!-- Why is this a threat to their claim? -->

**What would fix it?**

<!-- What design would address this? -->

---

### Study 4

> "Hospitals that implemented electronic health records had 15% lower readmission rates the following year. We conclude that EHRs reduce readmissions."

**The claim:**

<!-- What are they claiming? -->

**The main identification problem:**

- [ ] Reverse causality
- [ ] Omitted variable bias
- [ ] Selection bias
- [ ] Measurement error
- [ ] Simultaneity
- [ ] Survivorship bias

**Explain the problem:**

<!-- Why is this a threat to their claim? -->

**What would fix it?**

<!-- What design would address this? -->

---

### Study 5

> "We randomly assigned teams to use either Slack or email for one month. Teams using Slack reported higher satisfaction. We conclude that Slack improves team satisfaction."

**The claim:**

<!-- What are they claiming? -->

**The main identification problem (if any):**

- [ ] Reverse causality
- [ ] Omitted variable bias
- [ ] Selection bias
- [ ] Measurement error
- [ ] Simultaneity
- [ ] Survivorship bias
- [ ] **None - this is a valid experiment**

**If there's a problem, explain it:**

<!-- Or explain why the design is sound -->

**Any remaining concerns?**

<!-- Even good designs have limitations -->

---

### Study 6

> "We found that employees who receive more feedback have higher performance ratings. Feedback was measured by asking employees 'How often does your manager give you feedback?' We conclude that feedback improves performance."

**The claim:**

<!-- What are they claiming? -->

**The main identification problem:**

- [ ] Reverse causality
- [ ] Omitted variable bias
- [ ] Selection bias
- [ ] Measurement error
- [ ] Simultaneity
- [ ] Survivorship bias

**Explain the problem:**

<!-- Why is this a threat to their claim? -->

**What would fix it?**

<!-- What design would address this? -->

## Reflection

Which identification problem do you see most often in papers you read?

<!-- 2-3 sentences -->

Which is hardest to fix? Why?

<!-- 2-3 sentences -->
