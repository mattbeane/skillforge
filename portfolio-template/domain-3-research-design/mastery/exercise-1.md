# Exercise 1: Multi-Method Design Integration

## Context

Complex research questions often require multiple methods. This exercise develops your ability to design integrated multi-method studies.

## The Question

> "How does AI adoption affect the development of professional expertise in knowledge work?"

This question has multiple facets:
- Causal: Does AI adoption actually affect expertise development?
- Mechanism: How and why does this effect occur?
- Experience: What is it like to develop expertise with AI?
- Variation: For whom and in what contexts?

## Your Task

### Step 1: Decompose the Question

Break the big question into sub-questions, each suited to a different method.

**Causal sub-question:**

<!-- Answerable with quantitative causal inference -->

Appropriate method:

---

**Mechanism sub-question:**

<!-- Answerable with process observation/qualitative work -->

Appropriate method:

---

**Experience sub-question:**

<!-- Answerable with phenomenological/interpretive work -->

Appropriate method:

---

**Variation sub-question:**

<!-- Answerable with comparative analysis -->

Appropriate method:

---

### Step 2: Design Each Component

**Component A: Causal Identification**

Research design:

Sample:

Key measure of "expertise development":

Identification strategy:

Timeline:

---

**Component B: Mechanism Tracing**

Research design:

Sites/participants:

Data collection approach:

How you'll identify mechanisms:

Timeline:

---

**Component C: Experience Understanding**

Research design:

Participants:

Data collection approach:

Analytical approach:

Timeline:

---

**Component D: Variation Analysis**

Research design:

Comparison cases:

Dimensions of variation:

Analytical approach:

Timeline:

---

### Step 3: Integration Strategy

How do the components fit together?

**Sequencing:**

Which component comes first? Why?

<!-- How do they build on each other? -->

**Cross-validation:**

How will findings from different components inform each other?

<!-- What do you do if they conflict? -->

**Synthesis:**

How will you combine findings into a coherent story?

<!-- What's the integration logic? -->

---

### Step 4: The Argument Structure

Map how findings from each component contribute to your overall argument.

```
Overall Claim: AI adoption affects expertise development

Supporting Evidence:
├── Causal component → Shows effect exists and magnitude
├── Mechanism component → Explains how the effect works
├── Experience component → Reveals what practitioners experience
└── Variation component → Identifies boundary conditions

Synthesis: [How these combine into a compelling argument]
```

Fill in your map with specifics:

---

### Step 5: Resource and Feasibility Analysis

**Total estimated timeline:**

**Research team needed:**

**Funding required:**

**Access/permissions needed:**

**Biggest feasibility challenge:**

**Minimum viable version:**

<!-- If you had to cut, what would you keep? -->

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] Question decomposed into distinct sub-questions
- [ ] Each component has appropriate method
- [ ] Components are individually well-designed
- [ ] Integration logic is clear
- [ ] Sequencing makes sense
- [ ] Feasibility constraints acknowledged
- [ ] Minimum viable version identified

## Reflection

Multi-method research is powerful but expensive. When is it worth it vs. doing one method well?
