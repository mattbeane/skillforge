# Domain 3 Mastery Assessment: Research Design Intuition

## Overview

Design a complete research program and defend it against expert critique.

**Time:** 90 minutes
**Format:** Full design + adversarial defense

---

## The Challenge

You have received a major grant to study:

> "The long-term effects of AI assistance on professional skill development across different occupations"

You have:
- $500,000 over 3 years
- Access to 3 large professional service firms (law, consulting, accounting)
- A research team of 2 PhD students and 1 postdoc
- IRB approval for longitudinal data collection

Design a research program that will produce publishable findings and meaningful theoretical contribution.

## Part 1: Research Program Design (45 min)

### Strategic Framing

**What is the core theoretical puzzle?**

<!-- What makes this interesting beyond "AI is new"? -->

**What specific gap in knowledge will you address?**

**What is your overarching hypothesis or expectation?**

---

### Study Architecture

Design 2-3 integrated studies that together address your research question.

#### Study 1

**Purpose:**

**Design:**

**Sample:**

**Key measures:**

**Timeline:**

**Expected output:**

---

#### Study 2

**Purpose:**

**Design:**

**Sample:**

**Key measures:**

**Timeline:**

**Expected output:**

---

#### Study 3 (optional)

**Purpose:**

**Design:**

**Sample:**

**Key measures:**

**Timeline:**

**Expected output:**

---

### Integration Logic

**How do the studies build on each other?**

**What do you do if Study 1 findings don't support your expectations?**

**How will you synthesize findings into a coherent contribution?**

---

### Resource Allocation

| Resource | Allocation |
|----------|------------|
| Year 1 budget | |
| Year 2 budget | |
| Year 3 budget | |
| PhD student 1 role | |
| PhD student 2 role | |
| Postdoc role | |
| Your role | |

---

### Risk Assessment

**What could derail this research program?**

| Risk | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|------------|
| | | |
| | | |
| | | |

---

## Part 2: Publication Strategy (15 min)

### Planned Papers

| Paper | Target Journal | Key Contribution | Which Study(s) |
|-------|---------------|------------------|----------------|
| Paper 1 | | | |
| Paper 2 | | | |
| Paper 3 | | | |

### Sequencing

**Which paper do you write first? Why?**

**How do the papers relate to each other?**

---

## Part 3: Adversarial Defense (30 min)

### Reviewer 1 (Methods Expert)

**Critique:** "Your identification strategy for causal claims is weak. You're comparing firms, but firms differ in many ways beyond AI adoption. Any difference could be due to firm culture, hiring practices, or industry differences."

**Your response:**

---

### Reviewer 2 (Theory Expert)

**Critique:** "This is empiricism without theory. You're measuring effects without a clear theoretical mechanism. Why would AI affect skill development? Your studies describe patterns but don't explain them."

**Your response:**

---

### Reviewer 3 (Practical Skeptic)

**Critique:** "Three years is too short to measure 'long-term effects.' Professional expertise develops over 5-10 years. Your timeline undermines your central claim."

**Your response:**

---

### Reviewer 4 (Scope Challenger)

**Critique:** "Studying three professional service firms limits generalizability. How do we know this applies to other knowledge work contexts?"

**Your response:**

---

### Program Officer

**Question:** "If you had to cut one study due to budget constraints, which would you cut and why?"

**Your response:**

---

## Evaluation Criteria

### Passing (Mastery Badge Earned)

| Criterion | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| Strategic coherence | Studies build toward meaningful contribution |
| Design rigor | Each study is well-designed for its purpose |
| Integration | Studies inform and validate each other |
| Resource realism | Plan fits within constraints |
| Defense quality | Substantive responses to critiques |
| Intellectual honesty | Acknowledges limitations and risks |

### Excellence Indicators

- Novel identification strategy within constraints
- Theory drives design choices
- Contingency plans for multiple findings
- Publication strategy is realistic and strategic
- Defense shows deep engagement with methodological challenges
- Can articulate what would change their mind

### Failure Modes

- Studies are disconnected (portfolio, not program)
- Over-promising causal claims from weak designs
- No plan for unexpected findings
- Cannot defend against methodological critiques
- Ignores practical constraints
- Unable to make hard resource tradeoffs

---

## Submission

Complete all sections. Your research program should demonstrate:
1. Strategic thinking about research contribution
2. Methodological sophistication across designs
3. Integration of multiple approaches
4. Realistic resource planning
5. Ability to defend and adapt under critique

---

## After Assessment

Win or lose, reflect:
- Would you actually want to run this research program?
- What expertise would you need to develop to execute it?
- What did the defense reveal about your thinking?
