# Exercise 1: Identifying the Theory Being Violated

## Context

Every interesting empirical finding either violates, extends, or builds on existing theory. Your job is to identify what theoretical expectation is being challenged.

## Example

**Finding:** "Experienced surgeons make more errors when using new robotic systems than residents do."

**Theory violated:** Expertise theory predicts that experience improves performance. This finding shows a boundary condition where expertise becomes a liability.

## Your Task

For each finding below, identify:
1. What established theory/prediction does this violate?
2. Why would a reader expect the opposite result?
3. What makes this violation interesting (not just surprising)?

### Finding A

> "Employees who receive more frequent feedback have lower job satisfaction than those who receive annual reviews only."

**Theory violated:**

<!-- Name the theory and its core prediction -->

**Expected result:**

<!-- What would conventional wisdom predict? -->

**Why this is interesting:**

<!-- Not just surprising—theoretically interesting -->

---

### Finding B

> "Startups that pivot more frequently are less likely to achieve product-market fit than those that persist with their original idea."

**Theory violated:**

<!-- Name the theory and its core prediction -->

**Expected result:**

<!-- What would conventional wisdom predict? -->

**Why this is interesting:**

<!-- Not just surprising—theoretically interesting -->

---

### Finding C

> "Teams with higher psychological safety have more project failures than teams with moderate psychological safety."

**Theory violated:**

<!-- Name the theory and its core prediction -->

**Expected result:**

<!-- What would conventional wisdom predict? -->

**Why this is interesting:**

<!-- Not just surprising—theoretically interesting -->

---

### Finding D

> "Doctors who use clinical decision support AI make worse diagnoses than those who don't use it."

**Theory violated:**

<!-- Name the theory and its core prediction -->

**Expected result:**

<!-- What would conventional wisdom predict? -->

**Why this is interesting:**

<!-- Not just surprising—theoretically interesting -->

## Reflection

Which of these four findings do you think has the strongest theoretical violation? Why?

**Your answer:**

<!-- Make your case -->
