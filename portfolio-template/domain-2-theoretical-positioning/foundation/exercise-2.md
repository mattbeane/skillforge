# Exercise 2: Finding Your Conversation

## Context

Positioning isn't just about finding a theory to violate—it's about entering a scholarly conversation. You need to know who's been talking, what they've been saying, and where you can add something new.

## The Finding

> "Remote workers are more innovative (measured by patents filed) than in-office workers, but only when they have weak ties to colleagues in other departments."

## Your Task

### Part 1: Identify Candidate Conversations

This finding could be positioned in several different literatures. For each, describe what the conversation is about:

**Conversation A: Remote Work Literature**

What are researchers in this space debating?

**Your answer:**

<!-- 2-3 sentences on the core debate -->

**Conversation B: Innovation/Creativity Literature**

What are researchers in this space debating?

**Your answer:**

<!-- 2-3 sentences on the core debate -->

**Conversation C: Social Network Theory**

What are researchers in this space debating?

**Your answer:**

<!-- 2-3 sentences on the core debate -->

### Part 2: Positioning Statements

Write a one-paragraph positioning statement for each conversation. Use this template:

*"Scholars have argued [X]. However, we show [Y]. This suggests [Z]."*

**Position A (Remote Work):**

<!-- Your positioning statement -->

**Position B (Innovation):**

<!-- Your positioning statement -->

**Position C (Networks):**

<!-- Your positioning statement -->

### Part 3: Strategic Choice

Which conversation would you enter? Consider:
- Where is the debate most active?
- Where does your finding add the most?
- What audience do you want to reach?

**Your choice and rationale:**

<!-- 3-4 sentences defending your choice -->

### Part 4: What You'd Need to Cite

For your chosen conversation, list 3-5 specific papers (real or plausible) you would need to engage with to establish your position.

| Paper | Why It's Essential |
|-------|-------------------|
| 1. | |
| 2. | |
| 3. | |
| 4. | |
| 5. | |
