## Skills Developed

- Identifying what theory predicts and where findings deviate
- Mapping scholarly conversations and camps
- Reframing findings for different audiences
- Making strategic decisions about contribution positioning
- Writing compelling "however" sentences

## How This Helps You Supervise AI

AI can search literature and summarize papers, but it struggles to:
- Understand which conversations matter for which findings
- See how the same finding positions differently for different audiences
- Make strategic career decisions about where to publish
- Craft positioning that's compelling rather than just accurate

These are human judgment calls that require field expertise.
