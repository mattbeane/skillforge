# Exercise 2: Building a Literature Scaffolding

## Context

Before you can position your finding, you need to know the landscape. This exercise develops your ability to map a theoretical conversation efficiently.

## The Setup

You're working on a paper about **remote work and innovation**. Your finding:

> "Teams that shifted to fully remote work during 2020-2021 filed 23% fewer patents than matched hybrid teams, but the patents they did file received 15% more citations on average."

You need to position this in the innovation/creativity literature.

## Your Task

### Step 1: Identify Key Camps

Map the major positions in the remote work + innovation debate.

**Camp 1: Remote Work Enables Innovation**

Key argument:
<!-- What's their core claim? -->

Representative scholars (name 2-3):
<!-- Who makes this argument? -->

Key evidence they cite:
<!-- What data supports their view? -->

---

**Camp 2: Remote Work Hurts Innovation**

Key argument:
<!-- What's their core claim? -->

Representative scholars (name 2-3):
<!-- Who makes this argument? -->

Key evidence they cite:
<!-- What data supports their view? -->

---

**Camp 3: It Depends (Contingency View)**

Key argument:
<!-- What moderators do they emphasize? -->

Representative scholars (name 2-3):
<!-- Who takes this nuanced position? -->

Key moderators they identify:
<!-- What factors do they say matter? -->

---

### Step 2: Identify the Gap

Your finding shows a paradox: fewer patents, but higher-quality patents. Where does this fit?

**Which camp does your finding most challenge?**

<!-- And why? -->

**Which camp does your finding most support?**

<!-- And why? -->

**What's the gap your finding fills?**

<!-- What hasn't been considered or measured? -->

---

### Step 3: Write the Literature Review Outline

Structure a 4-paragraph literature review that sets up your contribution.

**Paragraph 1: The Big Picture**
<!-- What's the broader phenomenon? Why should anyone care? -->

Opening sentence idea:

Key citations to include:

---

**Paragraph 2: The Debate**
<!-- What do scholars argue about? -->

Transition from P1:

Key tensions to highlight:

---

**Paragraph 3: The Limitation**
<!-- What's been overlooked? -->

Transition from P2:

The gap you'll exploit:

---

**Paragraph 4: Your Entry Point**
<!-- How does your paper address this? -->

Transition from P3:

Your promise to the reader:

---

### Step 4: Draft the "However" Sentence

Every positioning has a pivotal "however" sentence that signals your contribution. Draft yours.

**Your "however" sentence:**

<!-- "Prior work has shown X. However, [your insight]..." -->

---

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] Identified at least three distinct camps/positions
- [ ] Named specific scholars (not made-up names)
- [ ] Explained what evidence each camp relies on
- [ ] Identified a genuine gap (not just "more research needed")
- [ ] Outlined a logical literature review structure
- [ ] Wrote a compelling "however" sentence

## Reflection

What's harder: knowing the literature or knowing where to enter it?

<!-- 2-3 sentences on what you learned -->
