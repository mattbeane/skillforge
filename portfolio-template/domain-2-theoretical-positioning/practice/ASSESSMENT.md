# Domain 2 Practice Assessment: Theoretical Positioning

## Overview

You will position a novel finding in an academic conversation of your choice.

**Time:** 45-60 minutes
**Format:** Written positioning exercise

## The Finding

Your AI research assistant has surfaced this pattern:

> "Analysis of 2,847 academic lab meetings (audio transcripts, 2018-2023) reveals that labs where PIs explicitly invited disagreement ('What's wrong with this?', 'Push back on me') published 34% more papers, but those papers received 18% fewer citations on average compared to labs with more hierarchical discussion norms."

This is your empirical finding. You did not choose it—it emerged from the data.

## Your Task

### Part 1: Choose Your Conversation (10 min)

Select ONE theoretical conversation to enter. Options include:
- Academic mentorship/advising
- Psychological safety in teams
- Knowledge creation in organizations
- Scientific productivity
- Leadership styles
- (Or propose your own)

**Your chosen conversation:**

**Why this conversation?** (2-3 sentences)

---

### Part 2: Map the Terrain (15 min)

For your chosen conversation:

**The dominant view:**
<!-- What do most scholars in this area believe? -->

**The challenger view:**
<!-- What's the main counter-argument or alternative? -->

**The gap your finding addresses:**
<!-- What hasn't been studied/measured/theorized? -->

---

### Part 3: Write Your Positioning (20 min)

Write a 200-300 word positioning statement that:
1. Acknowledges the existing conversation
2. Identifies the limitation or gap
3. Explains how your finding addresses it
4. Signals your theoretical contribution

**Your positioning statement:**

---

### Part 4: Alternative Positioning (10 min)

Now position the SAME finding for a DIFFERENT conversation.

**Alternative conversation:**

**Alternative positioning (100-150 words):**

**What changes between the two positionings?**
<!-- What's emphasized vs. de-emphasized? -->

## Evaluation Criteria

### Passing (Practice Badge Earned)

| Criterion | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| Conversation identification | Clear, specific academic conversation named |
| Literature mapping | Dominant and challenger views accurately characterized |
| Gap identification | Genuine gap (not "more research needed") |
| Positioning quality | Logical flow from conversation → gap → contribution |
| Alternative positioning | Demonstrates flexibility in framing same finding |

### Excellence Indicators

- Names specific scholars and papers
- Identifies subtle tensions within camps
- "However" sentence is compelling and precise
- Alternative positioning is genuinely different (not just rewording)
- Recognizes tradeoffs between positioning choices

## Submission

Complete all sections above. Your work will be evaluated on:
1. Understanding of theoretical conversations
2. Quality of gap identification
3. Clarity and logic of positioning
4. Demonstrated flexibility across conversations

---

## After Submission

Reflect on these questions (not graded):
- Which positioning felt more natural? Why?
- What would you need to know to choose between them?
- How would your career benefit from each positioning choice?
