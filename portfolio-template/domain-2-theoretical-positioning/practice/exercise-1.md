# Exercise 1: Positioning the Same Finding Three Ways

## Context

The same empirical finding can be positioned differently depending on your theoretical goals. This exercise develops your ability to reframe strategically.

## The Finding

Your AI research assistant has identified a robust pattern:

> "In our dataset of 500 consulting projects, teams that included at least one 'devil's advocate' (someone explicitly assigned to critique ideas) generated more creative solutions BUT had lower client satisfaction scores and longer project timelines."

This finding has survived robustness checks. Now you need to position it.

## Your Task

### Position 1: Creativity Literature

You're writing for a creativity/innovation journal. Position this finding in that conversation.

**The established view you're engaging:**

<!-- What do creativity scholars currently believe about critique/dissent? -->

**Your positioning statement (one paragraph):**

<!-- "Scholars have argued... However, we show... This suggests..." -->

**Working title for this framing:**

<!-- Make it catchy but substantive -->

**Target journal:**

<!-- Name a specific journal and why it fits -->

---

### Position 2: Team Dynamics Literature

You're writing for an organizational behavior journal focused on teams. Reposition the same finding.

**The established view you're engaging:**

<!-- What do team scholars currently believe about conflict/dissent? -->

**Your positioning statement (one paragraph):**

<!-- Different angle, same finding -->

**Working title for this framing:**

<!-- Different title reflecting different conversation -->

**Target journal:**

<!-- Name a specific journal and why it fits -->

---

### Position 3: Client Management/Professional Services Literature

You're writing for practitioners and scholars interested in consulting/professional services. Reposition again.

**The established view you're engaging:**

<!-- What do scholars/practitioners believe about client relationships? -->

**Your positioning statement (one paragraph):**

<!-- Practical angle -->

**Working title for this framing:**

<!-- Practitioner-friendly title -->

**Target journal:**

<!-- Name a specific journal and why it fits -->

### Comparative Analysis

| Dimension | Position 1 | Position 2 | Position 3 |
|-----------|------------|------------|------------|
| Core contribution | | | |
| Primary audience | | | |
| Theory extended | | | |
| Practical implication | | | |

### Strategic Recommendation

Which positioning would you recommend and why? Consider:
- Novelty of contribution
- Size of audience
- Career implications

**Your recommendation:**
