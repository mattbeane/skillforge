# Domain 2 Mastery Assessment: Theoretical Positioning

## Overview

Demonstrate that you can make and defend strategic positioning decisions for your own research.

**Time:** 90 minutes
**Format:** Strategic positioning analysis + live defense

## Part 1: Your Own Finding (Pre-Work)

Before the assessment, identify a finding from your own research (or research you're intimately familiar with). This should be:
- Empirically grounded (not hypothetical)
- Genuinely interesting to at least two scholarly communities
- Something you could realistically publish

**Your finding (2-3 sentences):**

---

## Part 2: Three Positionings (45 min)

Position your finding for THREE different scholarly conversations.

### Positioning A

**Target journal:**

**The conversation you're entering:**

**The established view:**

**Your contribution:**

**Working title:**

**Opening paragraph of introduction:**
<!-- ~150 words that set up the paper -->

---

### Positioning B

**Target journal:**

**The conversation you're entering:**

**The established view:**

**Your contribution:**

**Working title:**

**Opening paragraph of introduction:**
<!-- ~150 words, different angle -->

---

### Positioning C

**Target journal:**

**The conversation you're entering:**

**The established view:**

**Your contribution:**

**Working title:**

**Opening paragraph of introduction:**
<!-- ~150 words, third angle -->

---

## Part 3: Strategic Analysis (20 min)

### Comparative Assessment

| Criterion | Position A | Position B | Position C |
|-----------|------------|------------|------------|
| Novelty to audience | | | |
| Size of audience | | | |
| Competition level | | | |
| Your credibility in space | | | |
| Career alignment | | | |

### Your Recommendation

**Which positioning do you recommend for yourself?**

**Reasoning (one paragraph):**

**Second-choice positioning and why:**

**What would change your recommendation?**
<!-- What new information would make you switch? -->

---

## Part 4: Defense Preparation (15 min)

Prepare to defend your positioning choice against these challenges:

**Challenge 1:** "The other positioning would have more impact."

Your response:

---

**Challenge 2:** "You're not credible in this space—you don't have a track record."

Your response:

---

**Challenge 3:** "This positioning undersells your contribution."

Your response:

---

**Challenge 4:** "What about [specific alternative journal]? Why not there?"

Your response:

---

## Part 5: Live Defense (10 min)

Your evaluator will challenge your positioning choice. You must:
1. Defend your reasoning
2. Acknowledge legitimate criticisms
3. Explain your tradeoff calculus
4. Demonstrate flexibility without abandoning your position

---

## Evaluation Criteria

### Passing (Mastery Badge Earned)

| Criterion | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| Three distinct positionings | Genuinely different conversations, not just different journals |
| Strategic analysis | Considers novelty, competition, career, credibility |
| Decision quality | Choice is defensible given stated goals |
| Defense quality | Responds to challenges without becoming defensive or collapsing |
| Self-awareness | Acknowledges limitations and tradeoffs honestly |

### Excellence Indicators

- Positionings reference specific scholars and papers
- Identifies non-obvious connections between literatures
- Strategic analysis includes long-term career considerations
- Defense responses show genuine engagement with criticism
- Can articulate what would change their mind

### Failure Modes

- Positionings are superficially different (same argument, different words)
- Strategic analysis ignores career implications
- Cannot defend choice under pressure
- Treats positioning as purely intellectual (ignores politics/career)
- Unable to articulate opportunity costs

## Submission

Complete all sections. Be prepared for live defense of your positioning choice.

Your work demonstrates:
1. Ability to see multiple angles on the same finding
2. Strategic thinking about scholarly careers
3. Intellectual flexibility combined with decisiveness
4. Mature understanding of positioning tradeoffs

---

## After Assessment

Whether you pass or not, reflect:
- Did the defense reveal weaknesses in your thinking?
- Would you actually submit to your chosen journal? Why or why not?
- What do you need to learn to be more confident in positioning decisions?
