# Exercise 1: The Strategic Positioning Decision

## Context

Real positioning decisions involve tradeoffs. This exercise develops your ability to think strategically about where to place your work.

## The Scenario

You're a 4th-year PhD student. You've just completed a study with this finding:

> "In a field experiment across 12 hospitals, surgical teams randomly assigned to use AI-assisted checklists made 28% fewer technical errors BUT residents on those teams demonstrated 40% slower skill acquisition (measured by time to independent performance)."

Your advisor thinks this is a "solid AMJ paper." Your committee member (who studies technology) thinks it's a "top-tier MIS Quarterly contribution." A third faculty member (who studies medical education) says "Medical Education would eat this up."

You need to decide.

## Your Task

### Part 1: Analyze Each Option

**Option A: Academy of Management Journal (AMJ)**

What conversation would you enter?
<!-- Which OB/management theory does this speak to? -->

What's your contribution framed as?
<!-- In management terms, what are you adding? -->

Who cites this paper?
<!-- What scholars, what fields? -->

Career implications:
<!-- How does this position you on the job market? -->

Risk assessment:
<!-- What could go wrong with this positioning? -->

---

**Option B: MIS Quarterly**

What conversation would you enter?
<!-- Which IS theory does this speak to? -->

What's your contribution framed as?
<!-- In IS terms, what are you adding? -->

Who cites this paper?
<!-- What scholars, what fields? -->

Career implications:
<!-- How does this position you on the job market? -->

Risk assessment:
<!-- What could go wrong with this positioning? -->

---

**Option C: Medical Education**

What conversation would you enter?
<!-- What's the medical ed literature discussing? -->

What's your contribution framed as?
<!-- In medical ed terms, what are you adding? -->

Who cites this paper?
<!-- What scholars, what fields? -->

Career implications:
<!-- How does this position you on the job market? -->

Risk assessment:
<!-- What could go wrong with this positioning? -->

### Part 2: Strategic Analysis

**Novelty Assessment**

| Venue | How novel is the finding to this audience? | Why? |
|-------|-------------------------------------------|------|
| AMJ | | |
| MISQ | | |
| Med Ed | | |

**Competition Assessment**

| Venue | Who else is publishing similar work? | How crowded is this space? |
|-------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| AMJ | | |
| MISQ | | |
| Med Ed | | |

**Your Identity Assessment**

What kind of scholar do you want to be known as?

<!-- Think 5-10 years ahead -->

Which venue best builds that identity?

<!-- And why? -->

---

### Part 3: Make Your Decision

**Your recommendation:**

<!-- AMJ, MISQ, or Medical Education? -->

**Your reasoning (one paragraph):**

<!-- Make your case -->

**What you're giving up:**

<!-- Every choice has opportunity costs -->

**Mitigation strategy:**

<!-- How might you publish in other venues later? -->

---

### Part 4: Write the Abstract

Write a 150-word abstract for your chosen venue.

**Your abstract:**

---

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] Analyzed all three options seriously (not straw men)
- [ ] Considered both contribution and career implications
- [ ] Made a clear decision with reasoning
- [ ] Acknowledged opportunity costs
- [ ] Abstract is tailored to chosen venue

## Reflection

What factors mattered most in your decision? Would your answer change if you were a 2nd-year assistant professor instead of a PhD student?
