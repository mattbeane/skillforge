# Exercise 1: Coding Real Data

## Context

Coding is where qualitative analysis begins. This exercise develops your ability to code raw data systematically.

## The Data

Below are excerpts from interviews with software engineers about learning to use AI coding assistants. Code each excerpt.

---

### Excerpt 1

> "At first I thought it was going to replace me, you know? Like, why do they need me if the AI can write code? But then I realized it's more like... it's doing the boring parts. The stuff I didn't want to do anyway. Now I spend more time thinking about architecture, about the bigger picture. It's actually made my job more interesting, not less."

**Your codes:**

1.
2.
3.
4.

**Memo (2-3 sentences of analytical notes):**

### Excerpt 2

> "The dangerous thing is when junior people use it. They get an answer and they don't know if it's right. I've seen interns commit code that looks perfect but has subtle bugs because they trusted the AI. They didn't learn why things work, they just learned to prompt. That scares me for the next generation."

**Your codes:**

1.
2.
3.
4.

**Memo:**

### Excerpt 3

> "I use it for documentation now, which I never did before. Like, I hated writing docstrings and comments. Now I just tell it to document my function and it does a pretty good job. My code is way more readable than it used to be. My team lead actually mentioned it in my review."

**Your codes:**

1.
2.
3.
4.

**Memo:**

### Excerpt 4

> "There's this thing where you stop looking things up. Before, if I didn't know something, I'd Google it, read Stack Overflow, maybe read the actual documentation. Now I just ask the AI. It's faster, but I wonder if I'm learning less. Like, those Stack Overflow rabbit holes—sometimes you'd discover something you weren't even looking for."

**Your codes:**

1.
2.
3.
4.

**Memo:**

### Excerpt 5

> "My manager doesn't really understand what the AI does. He thinks we should all be twice as productive now. And yeah, some things are faster. But the hard parts are still hard. The AI can't debug a complex distributed system. It can't understand why the business wants what they want. The judgment calls are still mine."

## Codebook Development

Based on your coding, create an initial codebook.

### Code Definitions

| Code | Definition | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| | | |
| | | |
| | | |
| | | |
| | | |
