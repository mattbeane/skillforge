# Exercise 2: Building Themes from Codes

## Context

Themes are where qualitative analysis gets interesting. This exercise develops your ability to move from codes to themes systematically.

## The Codes

Below is a coded dataset from a study on how professionals adapt to working with AI tools. The codes come from 25 interviews.

### Code Frequency Table

| Code | Count | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| time_saved | 23 | Mentions of tasks taking less time |
| quality_concern | 18 | Worries about output quality |
| checking_ai_work | 22 | Verifying or editing AI output |
| lost_serendipity | 8 | Missing unexpected discoveries |
| skill_atrophy_fear | 14 | Worry about losing abilities |
| junior_risk | 12 | Concerns about new employees |
| productivity_pressure | 16 | Manager expectations for speed |
| identity_shift | 9 | Changed sense of professional self |
| delegation_to_ai | 19 | Giving tasks to AI tools |
| learning_differently | 11 | New ways of acquiring knowledge |
| automation_comfort | 15 | Being okay with AI doing tasks |
| automation_discomfort | 13 | Being uneasy with AI doing tasks |
| expertise_validated | 7 | AI made them feel more expert |
| expertise_threatened | 10 | AI made them feel less expert |
| workflow_redesign | 17 | Changing how they do their job |
| relationship_with_tool | 6 | Describing AI as partner/assistant |

## Your Task

### Step 1: Group Codes

Organize these codes into 3-5 thematic clusters.

**Cluster 1:**

Name:

Codes included:

What unites them:

---

**Cluster 2:**

Name:

Codes included:

What unites them:

---

**Cluster 3:**

Name:

Codes included:

What unites them:

---

**Cluster 4 (optional):**

Name:

Codes included:

What unites them:

---

**Cluster 5 (optional):**

Name:

Codes included:

What unites them:

---

### Step 2: Name Your Themes

Clusters are categories. Themes are interpretive claims. Convert your clusters into themes.

**Theme 1:**

Cluster it came from:

Theme name (interpretive, not just descriptive):

Theme statement (one sentence capturing the insight):

---

**Theme 2:**

Cluster it came from:

Theme name:

Theme statement:

---

**Theme 3:**

Cluster it came from:

Theme name:

Theme statement:

---

### Step 3: Theme Relationships

How do your themes relate to each other?

**Draw a simple concept map (describe it in words):**

<!-- Which themes connect? How? -->

**What's the overarching story these themes tell?**

<!-- In 2-3 sentences -->

---

### Step 4: Negative Cases

Looking at the codes, what doesn't fit your themes? What codes are outliers?

**Outlier codes:**

**Why don't they fit?**

**What might they tell you that your themes miss?**

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] Grouped all codes into clusters
- [ ] Clusters are coherent (codes belong together)
- [ ] Themes are interpretive (not just relabeled clusters)
- [ ] Theme statements capture insights
- [ ] Considered relationships between themes
- [ ] Addressed negative cases/outliers

## Reflection

What's the hardest part of moving from codes to themes? Where do you have to make interpretive leaps?

<!-- 2-3 sentences -->
