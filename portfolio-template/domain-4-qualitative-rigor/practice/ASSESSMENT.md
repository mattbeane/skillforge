# Domain 4 Practice Assessment: Qualitative Rigor

## Overview

Code data and build themes that could appear in a published paper.

**Time:** 60 minutes
**Format:** Coding + theme development exercise

## The Data

You're analyzing interviews with healthcare workers about adopting AI diagnostic tools. Below are 6 excerpts from your 20 interviews.

---

### Excerpt A

> "The first time the AI disagreed with my diagnosis, I was offended. Like, who is this machine to tell me I'm wrong? But then I looked at the scans again, and... it was right. I had missed something. That was humbling. Now I think of it as a second set of eyes, not a replacement for mine."

---

### Excerpt B

> "The residents now, they look at the AI output first. Always. They're not developing their own impression and then comparing. They're anchoring on what the AI says. I worry they'll never develop the intuition we have. They'll be lost if the AI goes down."

---

### Excerpt C

> "Honestly? It's made my job less interesting. The puzzles were the fun part—figuring out what's wrong with someone. Now the AI solves the puzzle and I'm just... checking its work. I'm a supervisor, not a detective anymore."

---

### Excerpt D

> "My patients ask about it. They want to know if the AI looked at their images. Some of them trust it more than they trust me, which is strange. One patient actually said, 'Good, I'm glad a computer is checking.' I didn't know how to feel about that."

---

### Excerpt E

> "For the straightforward cases, it's amazing. Saves so much time. I can see more patients because I'm not spending 20 minutes on something obvious. But the weird cases, the zebras—it's worse than useless. It just confidently tells you the wrong thing."

---

### Excerpt F

> "I've started ordering fewer tests. The AI is so good at pattern recognition that I don't need as much data to feel confident. Before, I'd order a CT just to be safe. Now I trust the AI's read of the X-ray. I don't know if that's good or bad for my patients."

## Part 2: Theme Development (25 min)

### Initial Codebook

List all your codes and brief definitions:

| Code | Definition |
|------|------------|
| | |
| | |
| | |
| | |
| | |
| | |
| | |
| | |

---

### Theme Construction

Build 2-3 themes from your codes.

**Theme 1**

Name:

Codes that support it:

Theme statement (one interpretive sentence):

Key quote that exemplifies it:

---

**Theme 2**

Name:

Codes that support it:

Theme statement:

Key quote:

---

**Theme 3**

Name:

Codes that support it:

Theme statement:

Key quote:

---

### Theme Integration

**How do these themes relate to each other?**

**What overarching insight do they point to?**

---

## Part 3: Critical Reflection (10 min)

### Limitations

**What might you be missing with only 6 excerpts?**

**What perspectives aren't represented in this data?**

---

### Negative Cases

**Is there anything in the data that doesn't fit your themes?**

**How would you handle it?**

---

### Saturation

**Would you feel confident claiming saturation based on this data? Why or why not?**

---

## Evaluation Criteria

### Passing (Practice Badge Earned)

| Criterion | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| Coding quality | Codes are descriptive, grounded in data |
| Codebook coherence | Codes are distinct and defined |
| Theme interpretiveness | Themes go beyond description |
| Theme grounding | Themes are supported by multiple codes/excerpts |
| Critical awareness | Acknowledges limitations and gaps |

### Excellence Indicators

- Memos show analytical thinking, not just description
- Themes capture non-obvious insights
- Theme relationships articulate a compelling story
- Negative cases are thoughtfully addressed
- Clear distinction between what data shows and what it suggests

### Common Mistakes

- Codes that are too abstract (theme-level from the start)
- Themes that are just renamed code categories
- Ignoring data that doesn't fit
- Over-claiming from limited data
- Memos that just summarize instead of analyze
