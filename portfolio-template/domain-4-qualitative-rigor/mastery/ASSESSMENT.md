**Time:** 90 minutes
**Format:** Full analysis + live defense

## Part 1: Analysis (60 min)

You have been given raw interview data from a study on academic research in the AI era. Your task: analyze the data and produce findings that could appear in a published paper.

### The Data

Below are excerpts from 8 interviews with faculty members about how AI tools are affecting their research practices.

---

**Interview 1 (Tenured professor, social sciences):**

> "My doctoral students use ChatGPT for everything now. Literature reviews, drafting, coding. I don't know what skills they're actually developing. When I was a student, I had to struggle through reading hundreds of papers. That struggle was the learning. Now they ask the AI to summarize. They get the gist, but do they get the depth?"

---

**Interview 2 (Assistant professor, computer science):**

> "Honestly, the reviewers expect more now. They see AI as a force multiplier. If you submit a paper that could have been written with AI assistance, they wonder why it isn't better. The baseline has shifted. A paper that would have been accepted five years ago gets desk rejected today because it's 'incremental.'"

---

**Interview 3 (Tenured professor, natural sciences):**

> "I've started using AI to generate hypotheses. I feed it our data and ask what patterns it sees. Sometimes it suggests connections I hadn't considered. Last month it pointed to a relationship between two variables that became the core of a new paper. Am I still the one doing the science? I think so. But I'm not sure."

---

**Interview 4 (Associate professor, humanities):**

> "The students who use it badly are obvious. The writing is flat, generic. But the students who use it well—they're producing work I couldn't have done at their stage. They're not just prompting; they're thinking with the AI. I don't know how to grade that or what it means for expertise."

---

**Interview 5 (Assistant professor, business school):**

> "My co-author wanted to list ChatGPT as an author on our paper. I said no. But then I realized I'd been using it for brainstorming, outlining, even drafting sections that I then heavily edited. At what point does 'I used a tool' become 'the tool was my collaborator'? I don't have a good answer."

---

**Interview 6 (Professor, engineering):**

> "The good thing is I can explore more ideas faster. Before, checking if an approach might work took weeks. Now I can get a rough answer in hours. The problem is I'm not sure which rough answers to trust. I've gone down rabbit holes chasing AI hallucinations. It's efficient when right, catastrophic when wrong."

---

**Interview 7 (Associate professor, medical school):**

> "I worry about the reproducibility implications. If I used AI to analyze qualitative data—let's say to help code transcripts—and that AI changes next month, can someone reproduce my study? My methods section says 'analyzed using inductive coding' but really ChatGPT did the first pass. Should I disclose that?"

---

**Interview 8 (Tenured professor, law school):**

> "My field is about argument and precedent. The AI can find precedents I'd miss, but it doesn't understand why a precedent matters in a particular context. It's like having a research assistant with perfect recall and no judgment. I use it constantly, but I don't trust it for the thinking—only the finding."

### Your Task

Analyze this data and produce:

1. **Codebook** (at least 10 codes with definitions)

| Code | Definition | Example excerpt |
|------|------------|-----------------|
| | | |
| | | |
| | | |
| | | |

2. **Three developed themes**

**Theme 1**

Name:

Supporting codes:

Theme statement:

Key quotes (cite interview numbers):

---

**Theme 2**

Name:

Supporting codes:

Theme statement:

Key quotes:

---

**Theme 3**

Name:

Supporting codes:

Theme statement:

Key quotes:

---

3. **Findings narrative** (300-400 words that could appear in a paper)

---

4. **Data structure visualization**

Describe or sketch how your first-order codes aggregate into second-order themes and an overarching dimension.

```
First-order codes → Second-order themes → Aggregate dimension
```

---

5. **Negative cases / tensions**

What doesn't fit? What contradictions exist within the data?

---

## Part 2: Defense (30 min)

Answer these critiques in writing, then be prepared to discuss them live.

### Critique A

> "You have 8 interviews across different disciplines. You can't claim disciplinary differences matter but also claim themes that cross disciplines. Which is it?"

**Your response:**

---

### Critique B

> "Your Theme [X] is indistinguishable from concerns people had about calculators, spell-check, and Google. What's actually new here?"

**Your response:**

---

### Critique C

> "How do I know you didn't just cherry-pick quotes that support your argument? Show me how you handled disconfirming evidence."

**Your response:**

---

### Critique D

> "Your 'codes' are already interpretive. 'Expertise anxiety' isn't a code—it's a theme. You've collapsed levels of analysis."

**Your response:**

---

## Evaluation Criteria

### Passing (Mastery Badge Earned)

| Criterion | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| Codebook quality | Codes are grounded, defined, and exemplified |
| Theme development | Themes are interpretive and well-supported |
| Data structure | Clear progression from codes to themes |
| Negative cases | Acknowledges tensions and outliers |
| Defense quality | Substantive, non-defensive responses to critiques |
| Methodological awareness | Demonstrates understanding of qualitative epistemology |

### Excellence Indicators

- Codes capture subtleties in the data
- Themes reveal non-obvious insights
- Data structure is publication-ready
- Negative cases strengthen rather than undermine argument
- Defense shows sophisticated engagement with critiques
- Findings narrative reads like published qualitative research

### Failure Modes

- Codes are too abstract or interpretive
- Themes are just relabeled categories
- Ignores data that doesn't fit
- Defensive rather than thoughtful responses to critiques
- Cannot articulate code-to-theme logic
- Overclaims from limited data

---

## Submission

Complete all sections. Your analysis should demonstrate:
1. Systematic, grounded coding
2. Interpretive theme development
3. Clear analytical logic
4. Honest engagement with limitations
5. Ability to defend methodological choices

---

## After Assessment

Whether you pass or not:
- Would you actually publish these findings? Why or why not?
- What additional data would you want?
- How would you respond if a reviewer said "this isn't science"?
