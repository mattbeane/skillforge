# Exercise 1: Defending Your Qualitative Analysis

## Context

Qualitative research faces persistent questions about rigor. This exercise develops your ability to defend your analytical choices.

## The Scenario

You've conducted a qualitative study and written up your findings. Now you face reviewers. Below is a summary of your study and the critiques you must address.

---

## Your Study

**Research Question:** How do knowledge workers experience the transition from expert to AI-augmented worker?

**Method:** Semi-structured interviews with 28 professionals (lawyers, consultants, physicians, engineers) who have been using AI tools for 6+ months.

**Key Findings:**
1. **Theme 1: Expertise Renegotiation** - Workers actively redefine what their expertise means, often emphasizing judgment, relationships, and "knowing what questions to ask."

2. **Theme 2: Temporal Compression** - AI compresses learning timelines in ways that feel both liberating ("I can skip the boring stuff") and threatening ("I never built those foundations").

3. **Theme 3: Identity Bifurcation** - Workers experience a split between their "technical self" (doing the work) and their "supervisory self" (overseeing AI). Many feel more like managers than craftspeople.

## The Critiques

### Critique 1: "Your sample is biased"

> "You only interviewed people who chose to adopt AI tools. What about those who resisted or refused? Your sample systematically excludes the negative cases that might disconfirm your themes."

**Your defense:**

<!-- How do you justify your sampling? -->

**What you acknowledge:**

<!-- What's the legitimate limitation? -->

**What you would do differently:**

<!-- If you could redo the study -->

---

### Critique 2: "How do we know you're not just seeing what you expected?"

> "Your themes confirm existing theories about deskilling and professional identity. How do we know you didn't just find what you were looking for? Where's your disconfirming evidence?"

**Your defense:**

<!-- What practices did you use to guard against this? -->

**What you acknowledge:**

<!-- What's the legitimate limitation? -->

**Specific disconfirming evidence you found:**

<!-- Cite actual negative cases -->

---

### Critique 3: "28 interviews isn't enough"

> "How can you claim to understand knowledge workers' experience with only 28 interviews across 4 professions? That's 7 per profession. You haven't achieved saturation."

**Your defense:**

<!-- Make the case for your sample size -->

**What you acknowledge:**

<!-- What's the legitimate limitation? -->

**Evidence of saturation (or its absence):**

<!-- What specifically repeated? What was still emerging? -->

---

### Critique 4: "Your themes are too abstract"

> "Theme 2, 'Temporal Compression,' could mean anything. I can't see the data behind it. You've over-interpreted. Show me the codes and quotes that led you there."

**Your defense:**

<!-- Provide the code-to-theme trail -->

**Codes that feed Theme 2:**

<!-- List them -->

**Representative quotes:**

<!-- 2-3 quotes that ground this theme -->

---

### Critique 5: "This is just storytelling"

> "There's no way to verify your interpretations. Another researcher might look at the same data and see completely different themes. What makes your reading valid?"

**Your defense:**

<!-- Defend qualitative epistemology -->

**What you acknowledge:**

<!-- What's the legitimate concern? -->

**What would increase confidence in your findings:**

<!-- What practices, if you did them, would strengthen the claim? -->

---

## Meta-Reflection

**Which critique was hardest to defend against?**

<!-- And why? -->

**What would you do differently next time?**

<!-- Specific methodological changes -->

**When is qualitative research the right choice despite these limitations?**

<!-- 2-3 sentences -->
