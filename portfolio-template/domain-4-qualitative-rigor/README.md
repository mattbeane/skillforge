# Domain 4: Qualitative Rigor

Developing rigorous qualitative analysis skills that AI struggles to replicate.

## Levels

### Foundation
*Can you distinguish codes from themes and recognize saturation?*

- **Exercise 1:** Distinguishing Codes from Themes - Understand levels of abstraction
- **Exercise 2:** Recognizing Saturation (and Its Illusions) - Know when you have enough data
- **Assessment:** Demonstrate qualitative fundamentals

### Practice
*Can you code data and build themes systematically?*

- **Exercise 1:** Coding Real Data - Develop codes from raw interview data
- **Exercise 2:** Building Themes from Codes - Move from description to interpretation
- **Assessment:** Conduct analysis on provided data

### Mastery
*Can you defend your qualitative analysis under scrutiny?*

- **Exercise 1:** Defending Your Qualitative Analysis - Respond to hostile reviewers
- **Assessment:** Full qualitative analysis with adversarial defense

## Skills Developed

- Coding at appropriate levels of abstraction
- Building themes that are interpretive, not just descriptive
- Recognizing real vs. illusory saturation
- Writing memos that advance thinking
- Defending qualitative rigor to skeptics

## How This Helps You Supervise AI

AI can process text and suggest categories, but it struggles to:
- Move from description to genuine interpretation
- Recognize when saturation is real vs. apparent
- Maintain the analyst's reflexivity
- Make the interpretive leaps that constitute insight
- Defend analytical choices under scrutiny

Your interpretive skill is what transforms data into theory.
