# Exercise 2: Recognizing Saturation (and Its Illusions)

## Context

"Theoretical saturation" is when new data no longer adds new insights. But saturation can be real or illusory. This exercise develops your ability to tell the difference.

## Saturation Scenarios

For each scenario, judge whether saturation has been reached. Explain your reasoning.

---

### Scenario 1

> A researcher is studying how managers give feedback. After 15 interviews, they notice that everyone mentions "being specific" as important. The last 5 interviews haven't introduced any new feedback strategies. The researcher declares saturation.

**Has saturation been reached?**

- [ ] Yes
- [ ] No
- [ ] Can't tell

**Your reasoning:**

<!-- What's right or wrong with this claim? -->

**What would you want to know?**

<!-- What additional information would help you judge? -->

---

### Scenario 2

> A researcher is studying workplace bullying. After 8 interviews with victims, they've heard similar stories: subtle exclusion, public criticism, impossible deadlines. The researcher expands to interview HR professionals and managers (potential perpetrators). The first 3 interviews reveal completely different framings of the same behaviors. The researcher continues.

**Is this researcher making the right call?**

- [ ] Yes, they should continue
- [ ] No, they had saturation at 8
- [ ] Can't tell

**Your reasoning:**

<!-- What does this tell us about saturation? -->

---

### Scenario 3

> A researcher is studying how consultants learn. They've interviewed 20 consultants at one firm and found three main learning strategies: shadowing seniors, trial by fire, and peer learning. Feeling stuck, they stop data collection and declare saturation.

**Has saturation been reached?**

- [ ] Yes
- [ ] No
- [ ] Can't tell

**Your reasoning:**

<!-- What might be missing? -->

**What sampling move might reveal new insights?**

<!-- How could they expand? -->

---

### Scenario 4

> A researcher is studying remote work experiences. They interview 30 people, coding for work-life balance themes. After the first 12 interviews, they developed their codebook. The remaining 18 interviews fit the existing codes with no new codes needed. They claim saturation.

**Has saturation been reached?**

- [ ] Yes
- [ ] No
- [ ] Can't tell

**Your reasoning:**

<!-- What's the difference between code saturation and theoretical saturation? -->

---

### Scenario 5

> A researcher studying innovation processes interviews engineers, managers, and executives at 5 different companies. After company 3, they notice the same tensions appearing: speed vs. quality, individual credit vs. team contribution, exploration vs. exploitation. They continue through companies 4 and 5, which confirm the patterns. They claim saturation.

**Has saturation been reached?**

- [ ] Yes, this is genuine saturation
- [ ] Probably, but with caveats
- [ ] No
- [ ] Can't tell

**Your reasoning:**

<!-- What makes this case stronger or weaker than others? -->

---

## Saturation Principles

Based on these scenarios, what principles distinguish real saturation from illusory saturation?

**Principle 1:**

<!-- What makes saturation real? -->

**Principle 2:**

<!-- What makes saturation illusory? -->

**Principle 3:**

<!-- What sampling considerations matter? -->

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] Evaluated all 5 scenarios
- [ ] Provided reasoning for each judgment
- [ ] Distinguished code saturation from theoretical saturation
- [ ] Recognized role of sampling diversity
- [ ] Articulated general principles

## Reflection

How do you know when to stop collecting data in your own research? What's your threshold?
