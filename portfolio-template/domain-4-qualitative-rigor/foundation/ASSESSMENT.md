**Time:** 30 minutes
**Format:** Written assessment

## Part 1: Codes vs. Themes (10 min)

### Classification

For each item, identify whether it's a code or a theme. Provide a one-sentence explanation.

1. "The paradox of AI assistance: more efficiency, less learning"

   Code / Theme:

   Explanation:

2. "asked AI for help"

   Code / Theme:

   Explanation:

3. "Trust is built through vulnerability"

   Code / Theme:

   Explanation:

4. "stayed late"

   Code / Theme:

   Explanation:

5. "Mentorship has become optional in the age of search"

   Code / Theme:

   Explanation:

---

### Theme Construction

Given these codes from a study on physician decision-making:
- consulted colleague
- ordered extra tests
- reviewed literature
- waited to see
- referred to specialist
- trusted gut feeling
- sought second opinion

Group them into 2 themes and name the themes.

**Theme 1:**

Name:

Codes included:

---

**Theme 2:**

Name:

Codes included:

---

## Part 2: Saturation Judgment (10 min)

Read this scenario and answer the questions below.

> **Scenario:** A researcher is studying how software developers collaborate in remote teams. They've interviewed 12 developers at 3 different companies. Their codebook has 40 codes organized into 5 themes: "Communication Challenges," "Tool Overload," "Trust Building," "Work-Life Boundaries," and "Collaboration Rituals." The last 4 interviews haven't produced any new codes, and respondents' experiences fit neatly into existing themes. The researcher plans to declare saturation and move to writing.

### Question 1

Has theoretical saturation been reached?

Yes / No / Uncertain

Explain your reasoning:

---

### Question 2

What sampling move might challenge apparent saturation?

---

### Question 3

What's the difference between "no new codes" and "theoretical saturation"?

---

## Part 3: Rigor Principles (10 min)

### Question 4

A colleague argues: "Qualitative research is just storytelling—there's no way to know if findings are 'real' or if the researcher just saw what they wanted to see."

How would you respond? (3-4 sentences)

---

### Question 5

Name TWO practices that increase confidence in qualitative findings.

Practice 1:

Why it matters:

Practice 2:

Why it matters:

## Evaluation Criteria

### Passing (Foundation Badge Earned)

| Criterion | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| Code/theme distinction | Correctly classifies at least 4/5 items |
| Theme construction | Themes are interpretive, not just categories |
| Saturation judgment | Recognizes limits of claimed saturation |
| Rigor understanding | Can articulate how qualitative research achieves rigor |

### Common Mistakes

- Treating all labels as equivalent (missing the abstraction levels)
- Confusing "no new codes" with theoretical saturation
- Unable to articulate what makes qualitative findings trustworthy
- Themes that are just relabeled code categories

---

## Submission

Complete all sections. Your responses should demonstrate:
1. Ability to work at different levels of abstraction
2. Understanding of saturation concepts
3. Appreciation for qualitative rigor
