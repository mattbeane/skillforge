# Exercise 1: Distinguishing Codes from Themes

## Context

Qualitative analysis builds from data to insight through layers. This exercise develops your ability to distinguish between different levels of abstraction.

## Key Definitions

**Code:** A label attached to a segment of data (a word, phrase, sentence, or paragraph) that captures what that segment is about. Codes are close to the data.

**Theme:** A pattern of meaning that captures something significant about the data in relation to the research question. Themes are interpretive and go beyond the data.

## Your Task

### Part 1: Classification Exercise

For each item below, identify whether it's a CODE or a THEME.

| # | Item | Code or Theme? | Reasoning |
|---|------|---------------|-----------|
| 1 | "feeling overwhelmed" | | |
| 2 | "The hidden curriculum of AI adoption" | | |
| 3 | "manager gave feedback" | | |
| 4 | "Learning to work with AI requires unlearning old habits" | | |
| 5 | "worked late" | | |
| 6 | "time pressure" | | |
| 7 | "Professional identity is renegotiated through human-AI collaboration" | | |
| 8 | "asked for help" | | |
| 9 | "Technology adoption is mediated by trust" | | |
| 10 | "expressed frustration" | | |

### Part 2: Building from Codes to Themes

Here are codes from a study on how new employees learn their jobs:

**Codes:**
- asked senior colleague
- watched YouTube tutorial
- made mistake, got corrected
- trial and error
- read documentation
- copied what others did
- mentor showed me
- figured it out myself
- got formal training
- learned from failure

**Group these codes into 2-3 themes:**

Theme 1 name:

Codes that belong:

---

Theme 2 name:

Codes that belong:

---

Theme 3 name (optional):

Codes that belong:

---

**What interpretive move did you make to create each theme?**

<!-- How did you go from description to interpretation? -->

---

### Part 3: From Theme to Contribution

Select one of your themes and develop it into a potential theoretical contribution.

**Selected theme:**

**What pattern does this theme capture?**

<!-- Beyond description, what's the insight? -->

**Why does this matter theoretically?**

<!-- What conversation does this speak to? -->

**Draft contribution statement:**

<!-- "This study shows that..." -->

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] Correctly classified all 10 items
- [ ] Grouped codes into coherent themes
- [ ] Theme names are interpretive (not just descriptive)
- [ ] Explained the interpretive moves
- [ ] Developed one theme into a contribution

## Reflection

What's the difference between a "theme" that's just a category and a theme that's genuinely interpretive?
