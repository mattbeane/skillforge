# Domain 5: Epistemological Genre

## What This Domain Tests

The ability to distinguish inductive/discovery papers from deductive/testing papers—and write appropriately for each.

**Source in TheoryForge**: `/eval-genre`, THEORY_BUILDING_STYLE.md

## Why It Matters

Many papers fail at review because the WRITING doesn't match the RESEARCH. Researchers conduct inductive, exploratory work but write it up as if they knew the answers before they started. Reviewers sense the mismatch: "This feels like the authors are retrofitting."

This domain tests whether you understand the difference between theory-building and theory-testing—and can write authentically in each mode.

## Core Competencies

### 5.1 Genre Recognition
Distinguishing discovery papers from testing papers.

**Discovery/Inductive logic**:
- "Here's what I observed → Here's the puzzle it creates → Here's what I noticed that explains it → Here's the theory that helps make sense of it"
- Theory comes AFTER observation
- Language: "I came to see," "The data revealed," "Informants described"

**Testing/Deductive logic**:
- "Here's theory → Here's what it predicts → Here's my test of that prediction → Here's whether it was confirmed"
- Theory comes BEFORE data
- Language: "I predicted," "Theory suggests," "As hypothesized"

**Common failures**:
- Writing inductively-conducted research in deductive framing
- Using "hypothesis" language in discovery papers
- Presenting findings as if predicted when they were discovered

### 5.2 Language Discipline
Using genre-appropriate language throughout the paper.

**Discovery-appropriate language**:
- "I observed that..."
- "The pattern suggested..."
- "This framework helped me make sense of..."
- "The data revealed..."
- "Informants described..."

**Testing-appropriate language**:
- "I predicted that..."
- "Based on theory, I expected..."
- "Results support H1..."
- "As hypothesized..."
- "The hypothesis was confirmed/disconfirmed"

**Red flags in discovery papers**:
- "Hypothesis Development" section header
- H1, H2, H3 format
- "Based on this theory, I expect..."
- "Results support the prediction"
- "As hypothesized"

**Common failures**:
- Mixing genres within the same paper
- Using testing language for discovered findings
- Not recognizing genre-inappropriate structures

### 5.3 Temporal Logic
Making the paper read as if the researcher learned things in the order they actually learned them.

**Discovery papers should read**:
- "I did not enter the field expecting to find X"
- "Initial observations suggested Y, which led me to examine Z"
- "The mechanism emerged from informants' descriptions"
- "Only after seeing the pattern did I turn to [Literature] for explanation"

**Testing papers should read**:
- "Based on prior literature, X should lead to Y"
- "Theory predicts that..."
- "I designed the study to test whether..."

**Common failures**:
- Discovery papers that read as if researcher knew everything in advance
- Retroactively framing discovered findings as predicted
- Theory section that "derives" predictions that were actually discovered

### 5.4 Structure Appropriateness
Organizing the paper in a genre-appropriate way.

**Discovery paper structure**:
- Introduction: Puzzle (not hypothesis)
- Background: Sensitizing concepts (not hypothesis development)
- Methods: Iterative process description
- Findings: Emergent patterns with evidence
- Discussion: Theory-building elaboration

**Testing paper structure**:
- Introduction: Theory and predictions
- Hypothesis Development: Derive H1, H2, H3
- Methods: Test design
- Results: Hypothesis support/rejection
- Discussion: Implications for theory

**Common failures**:
- "Hypothesis Development" section in a discovery paper
- Numbered hypotheses (H1, H2) in inductive research
- Theory before methods that "derives" predictions in discovery work

## Assessment Specifications

### Foundation (Level 1)

**Format**: Identification + classification exercises

**Sample questions**:

1. Classify each paper element as appropriate for Discovery (D) or Testing (T):
   - "Based on self-determination theory, I predict that..." [T]
   - "I came to see that workers were developing informal workarounds" [D]
   - "H2: Autonomy moderates the relationship between..." [T]
   - "The pattern led me to Weick's sensemaking framework" [D]
   - "Results support our hypothesis that..." [T]

2. This abstract is from an inductive study but uses deductive framing. Identify the problems:

   > "Drawing on expectancy theory, we hypothesize that performance incentives will increase worker effort. Using data from 68,000 worker-months, we test this prediction. Results support H1: incentive pay increases productivity (β=0.15, p<.01). We also find support for H2: the effect is stronger for workers with high ability."

   **Problems**: "hypothesize," "test this prediction," "Results support H1/H2," "we find support for"—all testing language. If this was actually discovered through exploration, it should use discovery language.

3. Rewrite this deductive-sounding sentence in discovery framing:

   Original: "Theory predicts that uncertainty should reduce learning, but we find the opposite."

   Better: "I expected uncertainty would reduce learning—but the data revealed the opposite pattern, leading me to question my initial assumptions."

4. Which section header is appropriate for an ASQ theory-building paper?
   - a) "Hypothesis Development"
   - b) "Theoretical Framework"
   - c) "Sensitizing Concepts"
   - d) b or c, but not a

   **Correct**: d. "Hypothesis Development" signals deductive testing.

**Passing threshold**: ≥80%

### Practice (Level 2)

**Format**: Identify and revise genre violations in a draft

**Materials provided**:
- A 5-10 page draft that was written with wrong genre framing
- Information about how the research was actually conducted
- Target journal genre requirements

**Task**:
1. Identify all genre violations (list with line numbers)
2. Classify each violation:
   - Structural (section headers, organization)
   - Language (word choice, phrasing)
   - Temporal logic (order of presentation)
3. Revise the problematic passages
4. Explain why each revision is genre-appropriate

**Evaluation rubric**:

| Criterion | Expert behavior | Points |
|-----------|-----------------|--------|
| Found ≥80% of genre violations | Sees what's wrong | 25 |
| Correctly classified violation types | Understands categories | 15 |
| Revisions are genre-appropriate | Can fix problems | 30 |
| Explanations demonstrate understanding | Articulates why | 20 |
| Didn't "fix" things that weren't broken | Precision | 10 |

**Passing threshold**: ≥70 points

**Feedback provided**:
- Complete list of genre violations (comparison)
- Expert revisions (comparison)
- Explanation of why certain phrases signal wrong genre
- Pattern analysis: what systematic errors did student make?

## The Language Rubric (Reference)

From TheoryForge's THEORY_BUILDING_STYLE.md:

| Problematic (Theory-Testing) | Why | Alternative (Theory-Building) |
|------------------------------|-----|-------------------------------|
| validate, test, confirm | Implies hypothesis testing | "is consistent with," "suggests" |
| hypothesis, proposition (formal) | Theory-building discovers | "expected pattern," "the theory suggests" |
| significant (statistical) | Implies NHST for confirmation | Describe effect sizes, patterns |
| demonstrates, proves | Implies definitive test | "is consistent with," "indicates" |
| predict | Forward-looking from theory | "I observed," "the data showed" |

## Journal-Specific Genre Requirements

### ASQ (Administrative Science Quarterly)
- Strongly prefers theory-building
- Discovery framing expected for qualitative work
- Avoid all hypothesis language
- Theory section should be "Theoretical Background" not "Hypothesis Development"

### Organization Science
- Accepts both genres but prefers theory-building
- If inductive: must use discovery framing
- "Sensitizing concepts" structure works well
- Avoid numbered hypotheses in discovery papers

### Management Science
- More comfortable with testing genre
- But still: match your framing to your method
- Discovery papers still need discovery language

### AMJ (Academy of Management Journal)
- Traditionally deductive/testing
- Hypotheses and tests expected
- But: if your research was inductive, say so and frame appropriately

## Common Misconceptions

**"All quantitative research is deductive"**
No. You can explore patterns quantitatively and discover things. Exploratory data analysis is inductive.

**"Using theory means I'm testing it"**
No. You can use theory as a sensitizing lens to make sense of discoveries. That's not testing.

**"Reviewers want hypotheses"**
Not always. ASQ and Organization Science reviewers may reject papers WITH hypotheses if the research was actually inductive.

**"I can frame my discoveries as predictions for the paper"**
This is exactly the genre violation that reviewers catch. Write authentically.

**"Discovery framing is less rigorous"**
Different, not less rigorous. Theory-building has its own standards: evidence, mechanism, boundary conditions.

## Self-Assessment Questions

Before taking the Level 3 assessment, you should be able to:

1. Read a paper and immediately identify whether it's discovery or testing
2. Spot genre violations in 30 seconds of scanning (red flag words)
3. Rewrite deductive sentences in discovery framing on demand
4. Choose appropriate section headers for your target journal
5. Explain why "I came to see" is different from "I predicted"

Genre mastery is binary—you either get it or you don't. If you're still uncertain about the difference, you're not ready.
