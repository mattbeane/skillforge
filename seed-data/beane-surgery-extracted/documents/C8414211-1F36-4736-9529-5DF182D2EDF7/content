This is a very subtle move, you are holding down like this is a straight laparoscopic instrument, you can use the wrist. Second, you see you’re getting some blod here, C and S wouldn’t care, I’m sure, but I do because you’re a rookie, and there becomes blood in field, and you want to clean that, it becomes tomato soup, and I can operate in tomato soup, you can’t so keep the field clean.</span></p><p id="597"><span id="598">Bleeding always comes down hill, never up, so you want to hit the top of the hill, the top of the hill.

So on the left side (dh) the mesnetary is stuck on the hole on a scale of one to a hundred, 1 being seasy, this guy is like a 2, this guy is very very nicely animated, yloook at the gerose fascia, you can see the kidney right there, it’s very very nice.

You know when I have B greab the bladder, it’s safer to get a bigger grab, it’s when you get a small grab and tput it on the small er surface area, when you get a bigger grab you distribute it more so you’re a little bit safter. Pull more left handpull more left hand more more, no one else is regtracint for you today, it’s just you and yourself. Hit this (d) that’s the tomato soup starting right there. You have to recognize that. Or you have to go really fast and not get into that stuff. Keep going. Pull more left hand you are going to have sto stop stop stop. (sw) take a break, it looked like you wresting to go trnas mesentery, that’s not good, thtat’s how you can get internal hernias and something.

So we’re just a few meillimeters. Stop stop, radical nepherectomy, that’s fair game, but in a partial, you could clip the ureter, and that’s not a good idea.
