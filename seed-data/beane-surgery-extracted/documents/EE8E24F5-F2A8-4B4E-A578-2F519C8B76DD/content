C hops in, explaining that when you pull back on it, it only travels in one direction, and barbs will pull when it goes back. Because the patient is in t-bird, the bladder is falling away from the urethra, so we need something that will hold it in tension. Before that, they had to carefully tie together multiple sutures, and they wouId have to have an extra person either holding up the bladder, and you’d have to constantly have a grasper on the suture, and if you let go, the whole thing came undone. “I still have certain habits, like I’m still holding on here, but I could let go if I needed to, especially after three of these. But I can’t quite bring myself to. Urologists pounced on this because it fulfilled a need that nobody knew existed. Now almost everyone used it.
