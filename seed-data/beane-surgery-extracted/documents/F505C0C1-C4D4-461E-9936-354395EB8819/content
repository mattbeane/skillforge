But it really depends. [on whether the cords were in]</span></p><p id="5"><span id="6">the other one, we just press a button, and self calibrates.</span></p><p id="7"><span id="8">I mean there’s an extra monitor up there, on the robot, make sure that’s working. Make sure, you know there’s a chair for him, people don’t bring that in. It seems small, but it takes extra time in the morning to run around looking for it. It’s kind of stupid, I know.</span></p><p id="9"><span id="10">The difference between here and 17 is between the cases if we have something else in here, we have to disconnect it all and bring it all out. So that’s a good thing, that sucks up enough time, you know? And we don’t have any more time to do it, right. So for the next case, so he’s using it for the first one, and he’s dealing with it, we might just leave it there, cause it will take more time to take everything out. If it was a different surgeon, would have to disconnect and take it all out. I mean, that takes time.</span></p><p id="11"><span id="12">In 17, we just took it away, and it’s fine. </span></p><p id="13"><span id="14">I bring extra everything. With a partial if he says to put in a needle driver to start the partial and start sewing, and I put it in and the needle drivers expired, then that’s waiting time, then that’s bleeding, bleeding, so I always bring a needle driver, and an extra scissors, and an extra clip applier, just anyways, because X is running down there, and we’re bleeding, and X is not always good to know where to look for things.</span></p><p id="15"><span id="16">Last night, they brought it down, usually after the case, we drag it back to 17. </span></p><p id="17"><span id="18">The cart, every time it comes up, has the wrong pack in it. Yeah, cause it just comes up with the stuff you need in OR 17, so we have to switch the pack, and get a monitor drape, and get a vision pack and there’s extra, and a white card wrapped up in it, so if you don’t have that little cart there, you run down to get it, and you’re…</span></p><p id="19"><span id="20">[People talk about surgeons having a hard time with it] It’s not half of it, yeah. It’s SO frustrating in the morning to start your day off, and you start off behind, try to pick up the slack from people the night before.</span></p><p id="21"><br id="22"/></p></body></html>
