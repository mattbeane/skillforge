Essentially their solution to resource sharing is a committee which includes every surgeon who uses the robot. “There’s a fair amount of horse trading that goes on, because, for example, we have two robots, and one offers functionality that the other doesn’t, so I might try to trade two old robot days for one new robot days.”</span></p><p id="5"><span id="6">You have credentialing that got set up during this time. You have to be proctored for a certain number of cases, you have to have a certain number of observations, and do a number of cases yearly to be credentialed within Lahey. You’re give time with the robot, and you have to book your cases within that time.</span></p><p id="7"><span id="8">The history of surgery is always that you’re trying to move things forward, to find the next best thing. And you’re not going to know in the beginning whether or how a new approach is more effective. It was the same with laparoscopy. What, that started in ’92, and there were similar calls – you should lose your license, you’re killing patients, it was crazy. Now, if you don’t do a bowel resection laparoscopically, people look at you with a little suspicion, like ‘why can’t you…’. For me, for a young guy in my early 40s, I have to look out and make predictions on about a 25-year horizon on technology [as far as which techniques/technologies are worth learning]. </span></p><p id="9"><span id="10">Intuitive is a real problem. They’re very aggressive, not so much focused on customer service. Hopefully they’ll get some competition, and the next one can hang from the ceiling and be more like an octopus, which would make multi-quadrant surgery much more practical, and positioning the patient, pushing in the robot, all that – that wouldn’t be so hard. </span></p></body></html>
