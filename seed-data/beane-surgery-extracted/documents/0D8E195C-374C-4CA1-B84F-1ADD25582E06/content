If I was efficiently using my time, and there was this dead space, like today, this will go down as a 60% utilization, because the clock runs out at 7:30pm, so as a result of finishing a very complex case that no one else in New England has done, you get penalized.</span></p><p id="5"><span id="6">It became a pseudo allocation based on percent utilization, okay? And conceptually it made sense based on metrics, I went along with giving time away for me because I thought it was the right thing to do for other people, because the result when I lost time on the new robot I said I’ll pick up time on the old robot, and that’s why all of a sudden all of the old robot times went up, because my case volumes didn’t change, they just took away the new robot and gave me the old robot. I hate the old robot. I hate it, I don’t have to tell you. I suffer in there, and I feel it’s a disservice to me what they’re doing.</span></p><p id="7"><span id="8">Me: Okay, so the driving explanatory force in your mind is this utilization logic?</span></p><p id="9"><span id="10">Yeah, that’s it, that is how it came about. That’s maybe what they thought, but that’s not what they told me.</span></p><p id="11"><span id="12">It’s financial. That’s it. It’s all about money. They don’t want to spend a nickel at this point. They are going to ride this pony until the pony doesn’t ride anymore. And if I suffer, and I do more on that old robot than any other person in this institution, right? I mean it’s unbelievable. It’s outrageous how much they’re fucking me. It’s outrageous how much they’re fucking me. They don’t give a shit. They don’t care about me, they don’t care about me as an individual, they only care about overall numbers. That’s it. This is a number place, it’s all about the money, it’s not about the people. If I don’t like it here, if I think I’m high performer, if I think I deserve better, get the fuck out. That’s how this institution works. If I don’t like it here, leave!</span></p><p id="13"><br id="14"/></p></body></html>
