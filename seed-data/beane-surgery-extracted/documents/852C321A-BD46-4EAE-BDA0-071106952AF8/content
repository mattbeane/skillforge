There’s a strong tendency for people to think, they have to know where the anatomy is at all times. That forces people to prematurely identify where things are, and when contradictory evidence comes out later on, they are too proud to change their minds. So it’s important to say “I think this is X, but I’m not sure, we’ll see.” But you should make guesses along the way, to help yourself along, but to yourself, you should be making guesses to yourself, if you’re wrong later, you can change. But if you just watch this like it’s a movie, but then the process is yup, yup, uh huh, yup. And then when it’s time for you to do the work, you missed, you missed the cases. Think to yourself, if it were me, I would go here next, and if I do something different, you ask yourself okay, why? That’s what active watching is, okay? So when you finally get called out of the dugout, you’ve done the hard work already, and you just have to learn how to use the robot, which is not the hard part to learn. Okay? ***</span></p><p id="616"><span id="617">C: and K, (head out) before your assistant gets somewhere, just wipe, just wipe an area to show yourself the bleeding.
