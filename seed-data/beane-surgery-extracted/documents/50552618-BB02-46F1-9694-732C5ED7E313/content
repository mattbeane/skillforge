If you change your retraction, push down with the scissor, then go over wwith the bipolar, no need to cut with the scissor, you just need to push it down, when you retract, unless you pull it back but with a solaid organ, you just push oon it (hand) it and go. Good, go on there, change retraction. Good. </span></p><p id="737"><span id="738">A: another suggestion. Don’t go that deep, take your upper part first. Go there.

Stay there. Bipolar, good. You can push awy the tissue, don’t push, yes, this there (hand motion up). Then you can retract, yeah. Then that vessel you’ve got there, then if you have the boipolar there, do the biolar more, more, push it itn more, take all that tissue. Keep holding with scissors, you are squeezing down, inthis way if you roll it, you can have the bladeswherever you want. Ssame thing with bipolar, roll it, roll it.
