They wanted to learn, so Ali helped train them. He proctored every case they did in the beginning, to make sure that they didn’t screw up these patients. The motivation was collegiality, that’s all the motivation was. They wanted to do it. They were interested, they were losing, they thought, marketshare, because they couldn’t do it. So that was the motivation.</span></p><p id="5"><span id="6">It got made because the three departments were going to be using it, and they hired a couple of people. The OR committee made that decision. It was purely financial, that’s it. Primarily financial. Some of it is market place driven, some of it is marketing, some of it it is educational, for the residency programs. Colorectal needed to have their fellowship to be able to say, you know that we have a good training program, they had to be able to say we do this and that and this and that, and good training programs, robotics are considered to be a part of it.</span></p><p id="7"><span id="8">That keeps with the teaching mission, and plus the ability to mentor people, like Ali scrubbed with GYN people, because we want to make sure that we work in a fuck up patients. It was my insistence, because I started the robotic program here at the beginning, I was a director of it, and then I turned it over to Ali. </span></p><p id="9"><span id="10">Where group practice, so we’re all in this together. Other institutions are much more competitive, each department stands on its own, so at the MGH, each Department is its own foundation, a separate foundation, so they financially, they fight over money they won’t collaborate as much we set up rules that said, in surgery, that you needed to do a minimum of 25 cases proctored before you could go out on your own in solo practice in this building.</span></p><p id="11"><span id="12">That’s to Proctor attendings to make sure they’re up to snuff, and it’s also to be able to train residents, because you got a be able to stop them, cause you take your foot off the pedal and that thing stops. And they can’t do it, they can’t hurt patients.</span></p><p id="13"><span id="14">Block time, you get so many hours a week to do cases, and then if you utilize if you keep the block if you don’t, however many hours you use after 3 to 6 month observation period, you want to increase your block or decrease your block. That’s decided by the OR committee. It’s based on percent utilization. If you’re not using your block, you have to release it to other people who need it.</span></p><p id="15"><span id="16">That stuff gets decided by the robotic surgical committee as to who gets to use which robot. They don’t have to move the robot, they move the surgeon into the room, say colorectal has a cup a kid case, they’ll get the dual console. If it’s a straightforward case, they’ll get the other robot.</span></p><p id="17"><span id="18">Basically, we’ve seen a decline in the utilization of the robotic for prostatic surgery because of active surveillance. So it’s probably 20 to 30% decrease in volume since maybe the last year and a half or two, because it’s much more active surveillance.</span></p></body></html>
