But most of your work happens in robot cases in the prep phase, and most of your work in the lap cases comes with the startup, and your work is pretty well evenly spread out in the open cases – you’re busy all the time.</span></p><p id="17"><span id="18">When you get new surgeons in who had already cross trained in robotics. They get it started. Francone had done it at the other place, Reed and Hall</span></p><p id="19"><span id="20">E: I have been inappropriately molested by the robot. ‘Inappropriate touching’ I say. </span></p><p id="21"><span id="22">See how one arm is really far down there? If he moves the camera when you try to switch out that arm, I’ve been decked. In other words it’s not really safe the closer if you stand to the robot. The only thing he will know if he hits something, or the arms clash, he can’t move his hand. Watch how he’s moving his hands, heal of a sudeen won’t be able to move. </span></p><p id="23"><span id="24">So can I switch to a 30 down, and can I get a fenestrated bipolar in the left hand?</span></p><p id="25"><span id="26">K: sure</span></p><p id="27"><span id="28">3:36:25 PM</span></p><p id="29"><span id="30">C: kay that’s good, I’ll take it from here. </span></p><p id="31"><span id="32">K: can I get the venestrated</span></p><p id="33"><span id="34">C: so N, that’s artery right ther,e and that’s vein right there. </span></p><p id="35"><span id="36">So what I do is grab the vein packet, and disclose the vein completely.

(echoey)</span></p><p id="65"><span id="66">C: that’s an operative vein right there, that comes off the roof. Sometiems it does that.   (head out)</span></p><p id="67"><span id="68">C: see how when the pneumo goes down, it balloons up again?</span></p><p id="69"><span id="70">3:49:51 PM</span></p><p id="71"><span id="72">C: part of why I like this fenestrated bipolar, is that you see how the tip is round, you see that? To me this is the instrument that’s closest to my finger. That makes it very gentle. It’s nice for lymph node. But not necessary, just preference. Now this is abnormal. </span></p><p id="73"><span id="74">N: do you do frozen on this, or (head out)</span></p><p id="75"><span id="76">C: no I don’t</span></p><p id="77"><span id="78">N: what does it not change the management?</span></p><p id="79"><span id="80">C: right</span></p><p id="81"><span id="82">3:51:38 PM</span></p><p id="83"><span id="84">N: what about bladder</span></p><p id="85"><span id="86">C: no, not unless I’m looking for a reason to stop the case, you know? In most cases, contemporary cases, you’re still going to benefit from prostatectomy</span></p><p id="87"><span id="88">3:52:12 PM whole time, J and E chatting, by table</span></p><p id="89"><span id="90">J has applied orange sticker</span></p><p id="91"><span id="92">C: allright, now you grab the bladder, right here. And now you can bring your suction in (points). No, that’s not doing anything. Right here, and push…</span></p><p id="93"><span id="94">3:53:27 PM</span></p><p id="95"><span id="96">C: that’s not nerve, it’s too floppy (dissects). Now that’s nerve, so I can dissect medially. You know how we don’t have tactile feedback, but I said floppy? </span></p><p id="97"><span id="98">N: yeah</span></p><p id="99"><span id="100">C: you can still see how the tissue reacts ***</span></p><p id="101"><span id="102">3:54:39 PM</span></p><p id="103"><span id="104">C: (head out) so you need to have the nerve completely in view (head out). I’ll say this till the day I’ve never had one, the auterator nerve is always where it’s supposed to be, its never in the wrong spot. It’s an avoidable injury that should basically never happen. I hope I didn’t have one, but if I did, I wouldn’t blame the anatomy. I hear in conferences, people saying the anatomy was so distorted. There was an anatomist who used to come down into the room and close his eyes (head out) and put his finger down and say ‘it’s right there’ and people would go “wow” but it’s always right there, it’s like an old friend.</span></p><p id="105"><span id="106">3:57:10 PM</span></p><p id="107"><span id="108">E comes over: So here’s a question for you – in all the cases you’ve seen, do you think people are more disjointed [in the robot]? Its just that except for a few moments like back there with the lymph node, they don’t really interact with us </span></p><p id="109"><span id="110">C: okay,  </span></p><p id="111"><span id="112">SW 4:01:55 PM</span></p><p id="113"><span id="114">C: little closer to the prostate, prostate. Just the tip of the scissors, not a full scissors length. Stop for a second, stop </span></p><p id="115"><span id="116">SW 4:02:16 PM</span></p><p id="117"><span id="118">C: I’m going to take this left hand, and we’re going to work together, okay? </span></p><p id="119"><span id="120">C: so Matt, in this case, he’s the right hand, I’m the left hand</span></p><p id="121"><span id="122">4:03:17 PM</span></p><p id="123"><span id="124">C: so we may not get a lot more mileage out of separating that out any more. So bring your fourth arm up over here, bring you scissors up, up up, you want to put your fourth arm where I am here, good now let’s go in. Good, cut right there (spreads with fenestrated),I would turn my scissors around. Again, again. Okay, pause for aminute. Okay, I’m going to take your scissors back for aminute because SW. When you start to see purple like that, we’re a little too close to the prostate. A little too close. So the plane needs to be adjusted, back here, </span></p><p id="125"><span id="126">4:05:14 PM</span></p><p id="127"><span id="128">C: you see that, this is the right layer, one more cut and it would be in the vein. So it would have been a little too hard to explain what to do there, you just have to look for clues, we were a little too medial. So there’s the nerve there, you don’t nnecessarily notice it. </span></p><p id="129"><span id="130">4:06:08 PM</span></p><p id="131"><span id="132">C: allright, can we get needle drivesw on both sides, and a 2 oh sh? </span></p><p id="133"><span id="134">C: so you notice that our 30 degree view is more like a zero (head out)</span></p><p id="135"><span id="136">N: yeah (head out)</span></p><p id="137"><span id="138">C: so that means our view is going to be a little harder. </span></p><p id="139"><span id="140">E comes over to ask what I’m noting. </span></p><p id="141"><span id="142">C: K, can you do it, it’s too important, it’s too important. </span></p><p id="143"><span id="144">K: yep</span></p><p id="145"><span id="146">4:07:38 PM</span></p><p id="147"><span id="148">C: okay, I’ll take bipoarl and sciosr? </span></p><p id="149"><span id="150">4:09:39 PM</span></p><p id="151"><span id="152">C: can I just get a johhny x for one second? Cscrubs in. </span></p><p id="153"><span id="154">4:09:57 PM</span></p><p id="155"><span id="156">C: so sometimes I can adjust the camera port in a way that gives me a better view of the bladder neck, so I may be able to jimmy this a little bit, so I’m going to change the port (he works on the camera arm, Trish replaces robe) Just gives me a slightly better view. So can we move that catheter back and forth again? Allright, ready with your suction nearby? Suction nearby?</span></p><p id="157"><span id="158">K: yeah, I’m ready</span></p><p id="159"><span id="160">C: my left hand N is here, (pans out to show) pulling. You almost let the tissue tell you where to go, you see what I mean? You see how this moves more than that moves? That’s a way of saying that this is softer than this, I think, right?</span></p><p id="161"><span id="162">N: yeah</span></p><p id="163"><span id="164">C: So you can’t touch it, but you can see it. I mean, rather than say with experience you’ll kow what I’m talking about, I’m trying to show. I think of this like a visual pinch, I’m pinching because of the contours</span></p><p id="165"><span id="166">N: right</span></p><p id="167"><span id="168">E and J chatting</span></p><p id="169"><span id="170">C: you see that’s exactly wher ewe were?</span></p><p id="171"><span id="172">T at computer whole time</span></p><p id="173"><span id="174">C: what would be cool is if we had an eye tracking thing that would show you where I was looking. If we did, you would see I’m darting like this (draws a U on the surgical plane) but also. </span></p><p id="175"><span id="176">C: N, there’s a strong tendency when you’re getting started to think you need to know exactly what’s going on and what you’re looking at. See how this line is a little weird? So then I just slow down, think about it, take my time. So it could be off to the left, over here. </span></p><p id="177"><span id="178">C: you can clean the camera, and putin a driver in the right hand? </span></p><p id="179"><span id="180">J still working on driver 4:18:48 PM</span></p><p id="181"><span id="182">4:22:28 PM</span></p><p id="183"><span id="184">C: so N, sometimes I won’t have the assistant grab the bladder? (head out)</span></p><p id="185"><span id="186">N: yeah</span></p><p id="187"><span id="188">C: sometimes I feel like it doesn’t accentuate the contrast between the bladder and the soft bladder and the firmer prostate become less.. (head back in)</span></p><p id="189"><span id="190">N: []</span></p><p id="191"><span id="192">C: less apparent, right now, I see it on the left, it’s just more apparent to me, so I’m just rolling with it. I don’t know, it’s hard to explain. You might say ‘hey, you forgot to have your assistant grab the bladder, but you’re okay, right?’</span></p><p id="193"><span id="194">N: yeah</span></p><p id="195"><span id="196">4:24:20 PM</span></p><p id="197"><span id="198">N out </span></p><p id="199"><span id="200">4:26:50 PM</span></p><p id="201"><span id="202">E and J talking, standing by, instruments nicely, neatly arrayed in alternating fashion (zipper) on nearby table, J talking again</span></p><p id="203"><span id="204">4:27:24 PM</span></p><p id="205"><span id="206">C: with a foley catheter retraction, there’s only one degree you can pull. </span></p><p id="207"><span id="208">Anesth is a zone, has been forever. </span></p><p id="209"><span id="210">4:28:50 PM</span></p><p id="211"><span id="212">C: so again, that dissection didn’t help us know where to go, but it told us when you arrive. </span></p><p id="213"><span id="214">N: yueah, it gave you the confidence if you’re in the right plane</span></p><p id="215"><span id="216">C: see, this is a very difficult posterior dissection (head out, N head out), you could be like ‘where’s the vas, where’s the vas, where’s the vas’. I’m sure you’ve had to deal with that before (waits for)</span></p><p id="217"><span id="218">N: yeah</span></p><p id="219"><span id="220">C: that’s the worst feeling of all, you’re all alone</span></p><p id="221"><span id="222">C: so now I’ want to give him the bladder to grab, so I can get at the pillars here. Allrigth, grab this (holding up bladder, backing out)</span></p><p id="223"><span id="224">C: get ready with a clip? </span></p><p id="225"><span id="226">J about to go for it</span></p><p id="227"><span id="228">E: wait, wait wait (only for J to hear)</span></p><p id="229"><span id="230">C: you’ve got to be careful, (head out) only remove it when you see I’ve got it straight (tool) you can do it now</span></p><p id="231"><span id="232">J: okay </span></p><p id="233"><span id="234">4:31:53 PM clip in</span></p><p id="235"><span id="236">Just checked with K – two incisions for him, M uses two big trocars, C uses one big and one small. Smaller ones are more dangerous to put in. </span></p><p id="237"><span id="238">C talks about a surgeon in Orlando who has done like 5000 procedures and has an approach to the prostate in which he dissects away the nerve sheath around the prostate entirely, without damaging it, and can just then pull the prostate out of the sheath. C has mjanaged to replicate this 2x only. N standing by </span></p><p id="239"><span id="240">C: when I started up in 2006 he had already had a huge jump on people, he had like 1000 procedures, and he was doing four a day. I’ve seen him, he’s just amazing, he would say “so this one’s difficult, because of an enlarged prostate” but he would do it just as fast He also has a very unassuming voice. </span></p><p id="241"><span id="242">4:40:43 PM</span></p><p id="243"><span id="244">C: okay, clip</span></p><p id="245"><span id="246">J: clip</span></p><p id="247"><span id="248">E: yup</span></p><p id="249"><span id="250">4:40:51 PM</span></p><p id="251"><span id="252">4:41:23 PM Scissor in</span></p><p id="253"><span id="254">4:41:32 PM</span></p><p id="255"><span id="256">N sitting next to C</span></p><p id="257"><span id="258">C: when I did my fellowship, I would basically be operating, from the point he came in, he would start operating. Normally, when the attending comes in, you orient them. But he didn’t want to hear it. He would jus tsstart Anything you say could be potentially wrong. So he knows. The first time, I tried to orient him, like ‘okay, here’s what we’ve done’ and he’d just say ‘thanks chief, I’ve got it’ and he would just go. And I asked his fellow [someone they both knew] what’s up with this, you know I try to orient him. And he confirmed it out loud, he said: “anything you say could be wrong.” And he would just go</span></p><p id="259"><span id="260">N over to K 4:43:33 PM</span></p><p id="261"><span id="262">T and someone chatting in the corner</span></p><p id="263"><span id="264">4:44:36 PM</span></p><p id="265"><span id="266">C: clip.

She said that this is a special situation – she’s trying to teach J to scrub the robot for colorectal, C’s teaching N, and C’s teaching K, so you have these separate things going. Normally, if we’re all used to each other and it’s gouing smooth, we’ll all be talking about something, like American Idol or whatever. On an open case, if you’re the circulator, you can’t really hear what the close group is saying, there’s all that humming, respirator sounds. </span></p><p id="285"><span id="286">4:51:43 PM</span></p><p id="287"><span id="288">C: can we check the 30 for amiunute (gets out)</span></p><p id="289"><span id="290">K: sure</span></p><p id="291"><span id="292">C: we just need to come at it from above (standing next to screen, N up next to him, hand gesture down on image of screen). </span></p><p id="293"><span id="294">C showing his one year old drinking a latte to group</span></p><p id="295"><span id="296">4:56:28 PM</span></p><p id="297"><span id="298">C talking about lap prostate – still standing in an awkward position.

There’s no sense in a new team completely reinfenting the wheel figure out why the arms are clashing because we already worked out thekinks, you know? It slows us down a little, but in the ned it’s much better for everyonbody, the colorectral guy doesn’t have to struggtle as much, the more of us doing this, the better it is for the hospital because if we can avoid complciations because as an instriituoin s we’re experienced, it’s good, you know?</span></p><p id="325"><span id="326">5:11:57 PM</span></p><p id="327"><span id="328">C: but when G, D are at the bedside, it’s a whole new level, it alsmost spoils you, they’re paying attention to the case, they’ve totally figured out my preferences, Dr. M’s preferences, they are anticipating, they’re there with you.
