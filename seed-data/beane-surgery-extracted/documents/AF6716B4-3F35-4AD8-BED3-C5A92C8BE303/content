X is really good about getting to it and turning it on (with the touch screen) in 17. Can’t do it in 21 or 22, though. And that’s where it’s a little frustrating for me because, they’re like “oh we need this we need this” and I’m like “yeah, I know, but, unfortunately, once here and I can control it from there.” So like the insufflator is in the boom, and you have to go over to it and turn it on. Oh, and “we need the room lights to green.” Yeah, no Shit Sherlock. But, that’s over here. And, “you dropped the so-and-so on the floor.” So I’m replacing that, and then I’ll get to the lights. [in 17] there’s just a couple of quick little dances over to the wall to get to the lights.</span></p><p id="3"><br id="4"/></p></body></html>
