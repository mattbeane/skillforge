He became quite directive at times, and a few times S called him over to ask him about surgical technique. His modal feedback was about zooming in closer with the camera, which S clearly had instincts not to do – she kept backing up to the edge of the trocar. There were a number ofpoints at which Rb stood behind the patient screen, looking down at trocars, at instruments being placed and used, and offering guided advice on what to do next.</span></p><p id="5"><span id="6">I’m noting now that it’s a hopeless task for me to capture all the dialogue in the room, let alone all the action. Especially with people like Rb in the room, there’s just too much complexity. So what am I studying?</span></p><p id="7"><span id="8">Was a significant number of staff in the room for long periods. At one point I stopped just to count there were nine people is a good for more than typical there were two residents one who looks very much like she was in training the robot specialists the circulating nurse someone who is training to deal with the robot a senior nurse herself, the intuitive wrap, senior resident who was doing things like sucking and passing needles and so on the surgeon herself, the problem was there for most of the procedure, and another nurse who was floating in and out just for coverage.</span></p><p id="9"><span id="10">The rep told me something very interesting, he said that MGH in its own way was very unusual. He set up in Lowell they do five procedures a day bing bang bang he said. </span></p><p id="11"><span id="12">There was a moment that made me get a new appreciation, accident or several moments a can be a new appreciation for the robot at what made possible. The first was that the surgeon and the residence had to do a couple things at the table that will were notable one was they had to take instruments out of various trochars and put them back and other trochars. Also the surgeon had to call for the bed to be moved in different ways at various points turn to the left turn to the right card up turned down and so on. You get the sense that this is probably necessary to a degree given that this is abdominal surgery in your dealing with the intestines moving all around and so on. But, and this is the kicker they were various moments that she was asking for it to be moved and the reason was very clearly because she was cramped all the way down in a squat. Or near squat anyway. And she was working for an uncomfortable position.</span></p><p id="13"><span id="14">What I find interesting there is that working from uncomfortable positions is part of the core of what doing surgery means especially for the surgeon. And so using the intuitive system is subtly and doubly counter to the surgical discipline. Efficient use of that system means constant clutching, which is the equivalent of being able to ignore or reset physical handicaps and struggle.</span></p><p id="15"><span id="16">I also noted in this procedure that the robot was brought in a 20° angle. The nurses were used to this, this required the rep’s guidance and so on. But what this did was a) subtly and deeply structured the practice, and b) quite specifically made it difficult for the scrub to hand sutures off and tools off and to take them back from the resident over the patient’s body because the robot’s arms spread up to the patient’s and beyond the patient’s left shoulder.</span></p><p id="17"><span id="18">Getting back to be used to feeling uncomfortable question, as I looked at the surgeon’s hands in the da Vinci control console, she looked like she had severe arthritis most of the time, and she also kept her hands out from the center of the visual field for a good 85% of the operation. The way I framed this in my fieldnotes is that she’s not decoupling axes of rotation in the physical world with those in the digital. Another example here of having it wired into her that she’s doing laparoscopic or open surgery is that she kept the camera hovering almost inside the trocar for a huge amount of time during the surgery. The way I would describe it is that she’s looking for the roof off the house view of the surgery, rather than the in the room view.</span></p><p id="19"><span id="20">Also interesting to note that it was only towards the end that she took her head out of the consult communicate with staff. This wasn’t notable because of the improvement in audio, all of that could of been part of it-it seemed more to have to do with taking your head out of the sand so to speak. Surgeons were pretty accomplished do this routinely they reengage with the material world around them with the zones of interaction that people are working in as a way of reorienting so that they can then stick their head back underwater so speak.</span></p><p id="21"><br id="22"/></p><p id="23"><span id="24">Christie: robot PA</span></p><p id="25"><span id="26">Cathy: circ</span></p><p id="27"><span id="28">Rosemary is scrub</span></p><p id="29"><span id="30">Lilly is resident</span></p><p id="31"><span id="32">Dr. Bordiano - Gen'l surg</span></p></body></html>
