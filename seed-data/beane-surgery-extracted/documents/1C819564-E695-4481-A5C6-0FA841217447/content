He said the way M uses the dual console to teach (he just observed a procedure yesterday) is amazing – the way he describes something, then punches in to demonstrate the movement, then punches out and lets the resident do it – it’s amazing (emphasis on that – AMAZING – he was really high about it). </span></p><p id="5"><span id="6">Resident – Casey Lebeis – said he would help me get connected – he’s in his 4</span><span class="charFormat1" id="7">th</span><span id="8"> year. Gained some weight, gave advice to outgoing med student – to take a break (post med school), celebrate, take out a loan if you have to, it’s worth it, you’ll get some money eventually, some day. And he said to write up his responses to some formal application process, that it wouldn’t matter, but that he should just go home, take a couple of days to chill, then do this. </span></p><p id="9"><span id="10">Also, they talked about Libertino – great guy, they don’t make them like that anymore, a recommendation from him goes a long way, you know? He’s so committed to education. All it takes is one person like that, all you need is one person, if we had more like him we’d have more people in our profession, you know? I had my one person, the residents were all so busy, he had me opening and closing up all his cases when I was a med student! </span></p><p id="11"><br id="12"/></p></body></html>
