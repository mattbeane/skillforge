In the OR before the robot, it was a total choreographed place, people barely needed to talk, then all of a sudden [with the robot] people have to adjust, and it’s awkward.</span></p><p id="5"><span id="6">We started at MGH with the robot in 2008, so we’ve been doing it 6 or 7 years, and you can still see some awkwardness. St. E’s is the only functional program in the Boston area, from my perspective. If you have $, you should go to Florida to see how it’s done. They have learned already a lot of the lessons we are going to have to learn. We have a ccommittee here that you should join as well. </span></p><p id="7"><span id="8">You can look at outcomes at different levels – what’s an outcome? </span></p><p id="9"><span id="10">The robot is like a new tennis racket – if you’re already a good tennis player, it will improve your game. If you’re bad, it will make you worse (you’re swapping in new tech where there isn’t basic competence), but if you’re good, it will make you better. </span></p><p id="11"><span id="12">The only outcome that really matters is [procedure] time. That’s what counts. </span></p><p id="13"><span id="14">Used to be 45-60 minutes to prep the robot here, just to set it up. In efficient places, its 12-15 minutes.</span></p><p id="15"><span id="16">Staff satisfaction makes a huge difference in program – are you frustrated, overwhelmed, or are you proud? Even the cleaning person – do they think – wow, I get to clean up in the room where this robot is being used?</span></p><p id="17"><span id="18">There’s a whole dissertation there: who is going to accept it early vs. poo poo it – early adapters.  </span></p><p id="19"><span id="20">2004-5 = 5-10% cases</span></p><p id="21"><span id="22">Last year 70-80% cases</span></p><p id="23"><span id="24">In 2008 no one wanted to do it, now some do some don’t, majority – you see it shifting, now general surgeon, because why?</span></p><p id="25"><br id="26"/></p><p id="27"><span id="28">So MGH is a good mirror of what’s happened nationally. </span></p><p id="29"><span id="30">Florida (Vip Patel) and Texas (Austin, Randy Fagin) – Texas Institute for Robotic Surgery</span></p><p id="31"><span id="32">I think, with two surgeons, who each have 20 cases per year, the surgeon doing open procedures will do worse, will have worse outcomes than the surgeon who does robotic procedures – it improves your game, because of the precision. </span></p><p id="33"><br id="34"/></p></body></html>
