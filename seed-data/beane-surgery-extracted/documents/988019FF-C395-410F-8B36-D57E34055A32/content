Like, I’m trying to think of an analogy… Like as if you were to say to a guitarist who only uses a pick, when is it good to use a pick and when to use your fingers. And it’s like, I don’t know, the pick is the way I do it. You become so comfortable say with pelvic surgery. Let me give you an example where this starts to get into a urologic debate. We’ve done so much prostate surgery that we have a comfort zone of operating in the pelvis robotically – it’s just very little thought, it’s just my comfort zone, so if I’m going to take a bladder out, I’m going to do it robotically. Now the benefit to the patient is harder to demonstrate- that minimally invasive bladder removal – cause it’s such a massive operation, they still stay in the hospital for a week, so somebody can turn around and say well, you can’t use the robot for bladder surgery, and we can’t see the benefit, but for me, I’m like I don’t want to do it open. It’s not how I operate. So you can tell me about the cost, and you can tell me about the benefit, but really, it’s my comfort that’s driving the decision. I feel like that’s something that’s really lost in the debate – I’ve never heard anyone actually say that publicly or in a paper or anything. You can talk all you want about the numbers and costs and benefits and everything. In general, we should do things with demonstrable benefits, and cheaper. But sometimes you’ve got a surgeon factor, I’m telling you this is how I operate. And if the hospital took this away from me, and tried to make me go back to laparoscopy, I wouldn’t want to.</span></p><p id="3"><span id="4">A really effective assistant who is following exactly what’s going on can make the case. The assistant can direct the console surgeon if they’re really good. They can place the suction somewhere that exposes the next place to cut without even you asking. I’m not sure you can teach that. You have it pretty much out of the gate. The mechanical stuff I can teach people, like “hold the instrument like this, push here”, but the “do you see what I see” is very difficult to teach. Let me give you an example: The standard pose for the bedside assistant is they’ve got their suction like this and they’re retracting the bladder. But if they’re looking at the field, they see the prostate and this tissue that’s coming down, they figure out that if they move the bladder, they can improve the field. They just constantly alter the traction to make the view better for what they know I’m doing. And a mediocre assistant they just grab the bladder when I give it to them and it slowly drifts to a very soft, relaxing place. I can tell based on how someone’s assisting whether they know the anatomy, just totally based on nonverbal stuff. </span></p><p id="5"><span id="6">That’s the beauty of having a team like this</span></p></body></html>
