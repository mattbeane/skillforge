Prostatectomy</span></p><p id="3"><span id="4">Though it was mentioned once, verbal communication failures were very, very frequent – perhaps one in five times, M was either not understood or misunderstood or not even heard. Even when he was understood, it was only T who understood or could hear him – to all others, M pretty much sounded like he was talking over a subway intercom. Quite unbelievable, given the cost. </span></p><p id="5"><span id="6">Given my previous experiences, I found M painstakingly slow in his surgical execution. Never making a serious mistake, but he spoke a great deal in much more tentative language than others I’ve been with, and asked the resident for their opinion in a relatively large number of cases. Also, given my previou experience, there was excessive clipping and concern about blood loss – a rookie mistake, I assume? Easily three, perhaps even four times the number of clips placed in other cases I’ve seen. </span></p><p id="7"><span id="8">This experience made the boredom issue abundantly clear – the circulator and scrub were completely inactive for long stretches – especially the circulator. Even the scrub was idle for long stretches, but they have more of an incentive to focus on the process, to be ready for next handoff. This is the kind of idle that is worse than assembly line work – mandated tasklessness. Mandated availability. </span></p><p id="9"><span id="10">Aha – it’s that the use of the robot is easier with a certain role complement – one that doesn’t exist yet. </span></p><p id="11"><span id="12">What would be the ideal?</span></p><p id="13"><span id="14">From dock to undock:</span></p><p id="15"><span id="16">Multiple concurrent surgeries. </span></p><p id="17"><span id="18">One surgeon, one PA per surgery (an upgraded scrub). </span></p><p id="19"><span id="20">Circ and scrub float between procedures. One circ per three, one scrub per two. Or if staggered, one scrub, one circ. </span></p><p id="21"><span id="22">Or, in the extreme – one surgeon per three-five surgeries, single central console, rotate digital feed between robots as parts of the procedure move along. Digital proctoring on a matrix screen, all procedures live fed, tap into any one audio wise and digitally. One fellow per partner console, fellow and surgeon tandem. Perhaps one to three. </span></p><p id="23"><span id="24">Rotate table half and robot half.
