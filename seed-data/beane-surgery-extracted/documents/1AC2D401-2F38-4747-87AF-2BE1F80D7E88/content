Well, they wanted to learn, so Ali helped train them, he proctored every case they did so we made sure they didn’t screw up these patients. The motivation was collegiality, that’s the motivation. They wanted to do it, they were interested, they were losing, they thought, marketshare, they couldn’t do it. So that was the motivation. </span></p><p id="7"><span id="8">It got made because the three departments were going to be using it, and the third department was colorectal, and they hired a couple of people. Jason, Francone, Rocco Ricciardi. But Francone was the guy at Rochester who did a lot of robotic stuff. The OR committee decided that. Ali is the chairman, he is the director of robotic surgery at the clinic. </span></p><p id="9"><span id="10">It’s purely financial, primarily financial, some of it is market place driven, some of it is marketing, some of it is educational for the residency programs. Colorectal needed to have their fellowship, to be able to say you know that we have a good training program and we do this and that and this and that, you know, good training programs, robotics is already considered to be a part of it. </span></p><p id="11"><span id="12">The reason we didn’t go for that second one was because of two things. The lease ran out. Everyone else was buying robots all over the place. So we wanted to see what the market did, so the other thing is that that’s about the same time when GYN was getting interested in using it and then later a couple of years later colorectal. So.</span></p><p id="13"><span id="14">And it’s a dual console thing, so that keeps with the tepee teaching mission. And plus the ability to mentor people and you know like Ali would scrub with the GYN people because we wanted to make sure we weren’t going to fuck up patients. That was my insistence, because I started the robotic program here at the beginning and I was a director of it and then I turned it over to Ali. Where group practice so we’re all in this together other institutions are much more competitive with each other each department has their own resources so at their MGH each department is its own foundation so financially they fight over money they don’t collaborate as much, they don’t have as much incentive to do this, think. We set up rules that said in the surgery that you needed to do a minimum of 25 cases proctored before you could go out on your own to practice in this building. I don’t even think 25 cases is enough, I think probably 200 is a better number.</span></p><p id="15"><span id="16">That’s the proctored 10 things, to make sure they’re up to snuff, and it’s also to be able to train residents because you have to be able to stop them if they do if you take your foot off the pedal that thing stops and they can’t do it - they can’t hurt people.</span></p><p id="17"><span id="18">Block time you get so many hours a week to do cases, and if you utilize if you keep the block and if you don’t, however many hours you use after three or six month observation. You either increase your block or decrease it. Decided by the OR committee. You make the decision to how much to allocate based on percent utilization. That stuff gets decided by the robotic surgical committee. </span></p><p id="19"><span id="20">We’ve seen a decline historically in the utilization of the robotic for prostatic surgery because of active surveillance. So it’s probably 20 to 30% decrease in volume since maybe the last year and a half or two. Because it’s much more active surveillance, based on the guidelines in that committee.</span></p><p id="21"><span id="22">In the beginning when minimally invasive surgery came on board, </span></p><p id="23"><span id="24">A first assistant can make or break you: key rule. If I just relax and don’t give them good exposure, they’re fucked. They’re screwed, the patient’s screwed. And if I give them great exposure, then the patient’s benefitted, the operation goes smoothly, they know exactly where they need to go, and they’re not afraid, cause they can actually see what they’re doing. If you don’t create the right exposure and you force the resident to operating blindly under tissue they can’t see, you can cut the renal artery or renal vein.</span></p><p id="25"><span id="26">I never watch the clock. Reason being is what I have to do has to last 20 or 25 years, so I don’t care if it’s a half an hour longer or not. Rushing is haste makes waste, one step forward, two backwards, you rush, cut the renal vein, repair it, it’s going to take you twice as long as if it were careful, judicious dissection. So you should never rush.</span></p><p id="27"><span id="28">What happens is is in the beginning, when I first came here, I had like every other young surgeon, wanting to prove his mettle, you know you want to do everything, like “look, I did that an hour and a half”. So my first case was a girl who had an extrophy, she was the daughter of a Canadian doctor. So I needed to take out her extrophic bladder, which is on the skin, that was easy. And I had to do an ileal loop, and I finished everything in an hour and a half, and my colleague Dr. Zinman came in, and he said: “what are you rushing for? You shouldn’t do that, never watch the clock.” So, after that, I just settled down and my pace is determined by what I’m dealing with. The tougher the case, the slower my face, like Thursday, we were digging to ureters, out of cement, in a guy who had a cystectomy and a loop, who had a leak, they went back and fix it, continue to leak any got concrete around his anastomosis, and he got a bowel obstruction and went into fix that, and so on the fourth time, so when I’m in, I’m not rushing. I’m taking my time. Because if I make a hole in the bowel, he’s screwed. But then, dissecting the concrete, around his ureters? I was dissecting to get off the common iliac artery, again, if I blow hole in that, you know, then we could fix it up, but, you know clamping the article artery to the leg that puts the leg at risk, not good, so you take your time. I think, moving to field around, makes the operation efficient, getting the right exposure is critical. You don’t have to rush. You know, if you do it right, set up the game, you set up the board properly, then you give GFE, which is Great Fucking Exposure, instead of OFE, which is ordinary fucking exposure.</span></p><p id="29"><br id="30"/></p></body></html>
