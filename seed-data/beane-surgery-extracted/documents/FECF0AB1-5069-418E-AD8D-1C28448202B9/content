This was clearly a pain point especially for non-urological services who felt like scheduling time was so difficult that they would end up “losing patients to the Brigham”. Shahin said, after some discussion with Peter that he had adjusted his practice so that he only took the number of patients that the robot schedule would allow. In other words he could take more robotic surgery patients in a number of others seem to feel the same way but they had artificially reduced their patient load in order to accommodate what they saw as an excessively restrictive scheduling protocol.</span></p><p id="9"><span id="10">Dog mentioned to me at the end of the meeting that he had had to build up a practice from Ground Zero at Walter Reed medical, and that in the beginning it was like this, and then they got to a better place. I asked him how long he thought it would take at MGH and he said 18 months. Echoing a number of others comments, Amira suggested that there be a single point of contact for scheduling all robotic procedures, as they were too many people who had too much overlapping authority in terms of scheduling these procedures.</span></p><p id="11"><span id="12">This interesting chicken and egg problem here: perioperative services believes that even if they got a dedicated robot operating room that there wouldn’t be the volume needed in order to fully utilize that room, and therefore they can’t have a vacant operating room and therefore there will be no robotic dedicated operating room. From the surgeon’s perspective, especially the surgeons who do us a procedures such as urology, surgical volumes are artificially low because it is so difficult to schedule time on the robot in the operating room as I mentioned above. The challenge here apparently is that if they want the robot in a time that it looks like it’s available to them they have to swap operating room time that they have on their books for it, and that operating room time has to be on that same day. So for example with dog, he might be in the clinic on Thursdays and have operating room time on Tuesdays but the only days at the robot comes up as unscheduled or available or on Thursdays and therefore he doesn’t have operating room time to swap for it and just gives up. He said that he is the capability of doing these surgeries laparoscopically or robotically so it’s no skin off his nose and he’ll just do the microscopically therefore he’s underutilized in the robot. Apparently he’s one of the more skilled and experienced robotic surgeons and the entire group, but he’s not getting to utilize this capability.</span></p><p id="13"><span id="14">Once this chicken and egg problem got on the table, that is to say once Peter understood clearly that surgeons felt that they were artificially limiting their practice because of Robot availability, Peter immediately said something along the lines of “you need to bring that to your chiefs of service, because that’s not what I’m hearing. What I’m hearing is that there isn’t a volume to justify the operating room.” There was a visible widespread reaction in the room when Peter said this some rolling of eyes a fair amount of laughter sitting back in chairs and so on. All the hallmarks of an undiscussable issue. Shahin said quietly something long-lived of “whoa that’s a whole other story”, but then he did say yes, yes we need to bring this to our chiefs.</span></p><p id="15"><span id="16">As Bethany presented the da Vinci robot cases of volume by service and surgeon chart, she indicated that it was in fiscal year 2010 that they stopped putting a limitation on the number procedures that could be performed with the da Vinci. She noted that they had not seen a significant increase in robot utilization after that point, and they had therefore concluded that about 180 procedures was the number of procedures that the institution was going to need to accommodate. Peter further said that from the beginning the plan was for access to the robot to be limited to urology gynecology in general surgery, and that someone named Scott was particularly focused on quality of procedures and didn’t want scattershot and very low utilization with any given individual surgeon.</span></p><p id="17"><br id="18"/></p></body></html>
