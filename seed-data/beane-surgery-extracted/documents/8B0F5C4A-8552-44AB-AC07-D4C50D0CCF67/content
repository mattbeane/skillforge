And the public wants it. There’s a huge, um. Advertising part. Get this into the public’s mind, if you will, and so Lahey felt that they needed to give that choice to people.”</span></p><p id="5"><span id="6">I don’t know who makes the decision to get these very expensive machines. I almost think it might be a combination of public relations people with business people and surgeons. You know, they come together and have meetings and say well, this is what the public wants, we’ve heard great things, we at least need to try it. It’s definitely a modern thing, and Lahey is on the cutting edge so it’s all very noble… </span></p><p id="7"><span id="8">Dr. T was the laparoscopic guy who came and he was such a master at laparoscopic because he had the physical ability and strength and brilliance him of never seeing anyone with a better sense of three-dimensional anatomy. So, he thought well I don’t need anything else. I’m very comfortable with my instruments. But you have to understand that the instruments are very long, At the end of the day you’re going to be very tired, you have to have a lot of physical strength. Now he was a decathlete, nearly in the Olympics. So, you need a lot of physical strength to manipulate those instruments and have the facility to so with long needle holders. And he made it look easy. And it is not easy.</span></p><p id="9"><span id="10">So I think when he first sat down to do the robot, and he realized, “wow, I have wristed instruments, I can sit down and see, I can even see better, I don’t stand up and really study the monitors. I don’t have to fuss with the camera that way. For someone who has such great facility to do this kind of surgery, the robot was a natural development for him, and I think he decided “wow, for me, it’s just as good, if not better, than laparoscopic surgery.” He became very comfortable with it. He could do three cases a day. He could do it both ways but he wasn’t going to be as tired during the robotic. So for someone who has great laparoscopic ability to begin with, they’re going to be able to do the robot probably easier, do you know to mean? </span></p><p id="11"><span id="12">There are certain difficulties that the nurses had to deal with setting up the rooms, and you’ve heard all that stuff. Emotionally I think most of us have this negative feeling because of the volume of work. This is what I always say: it’s like setting up for a dinner party with the fancy stuff, so the good shine if you will. The silverware, flowers on the table, whatever you think of, cleaning the room, getting ready for Thanksgiving or whatever. Having the party, dealing with all the dirty dishes, and then starting all over again when you have a second case. So you have a monumental amount of work in small little stuff to do to get ready. And you’re focusing on all these sort of technical things the robot has draping that is difficult, it’s difficult for me, it takes a minimum of 10 to 15 to 20 minutes and then you have to deal with the camera and get that white balanced, or stereo balance and all that stuff.</span></p><p id="13"><span id="14">So much to do that you have three people setting up the case and its you can do it in 45 minutes but it really takes an hour, because you did all the other work that you would do to set up a case. You have to take care of patient, so you have to interview the patient and get the room ready, and you now get all the other stuff ready for a patient. But because the robot needs so many things, you have to focus on that. Now that sounds like we’re just complaining, but. But you get on this treadmill and do so much to do and there’s a lot to forget too. The more tasks people have, the easier it is to serve forget something, and then there are idiosyncrasies for each surgeon, you know, do they like this title or do they like this pedal. It sounds sort of ridiculous, but it can ruin their day, just for four seconds. </span></p><p id="15"><span id="16">The surgeons have no idea what it takes to get a case going, I don’t think. They have no idea. All they do is come in and say are ready, are you going to be ready?</span></p><p id="17"><span id="18">I think the robot is a really, I think it’s a good thing. But I don’t think it makes a bad surgeon a good surgeon. These are all great surgeons, they don’t do open cases, they could if they had to. But they know their anatomy, they’re very comfortable laparoscopically, so the robot really works for them. You go to other hospitals and you have to be very good at laparoscopic work before you can just go to the robot. It doesn’t automatically make you have more skill. It doesn’t cure your lack of anatomy knowledge or anything. You still struggle, and I’ve seen robotic surgeons struggle who are not part of urology. </span></p><p id="19"><span id="20">We’re </span><span class="charFormat1" id="21">never</span><span id="22"> going to pay for those robots. It doesn’t matter </span><span class="charFormat1" id="23">how</span><span id="24"> many cases we do, they say. We’re never going to recoup the money we spent on this technology. Their multimillion dollar things, and the reimbursement for the cases is very small. And instruments, every instrument that’s put into those trochars, that’s a few hundred dollars, charged the patient every time. Do they really get charged? No. Because the insurance company pays just one fee. </span></p><p id="25"><br id="26"/></p></body></html>
