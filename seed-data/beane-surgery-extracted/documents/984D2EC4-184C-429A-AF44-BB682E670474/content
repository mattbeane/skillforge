You never know. </span></p><p class="paraFormat1" id="5"><span id="6">D: Everybody has their little subspecialty within urology. Mine is minimally invasive and robotic, so that’s why I end up with Canes so often (and Moinzadeh and x). They want you to have another subspecialty outside of urology too, but it’s so hard.</span></p><p class="paraFormat1" id="7"><span id="8">As a circulating nurse, it’s not quite as hard to swap into another specialty, but it’s much harder as a scrub. It’s much more (does hand motion for a tray, reaching for an item, then the next). You get a rhythm going. Can’t anticipate which adds time – on subspecialties. </span></p><p id="9"><a href="mailto:Danielle.s.clark@lahey.org" id="10"><span class="charFormat1" id="11">Danielle.s.clark@lahey.org</span></a></p><p id="12"><a href="mailto:Katelyn.m.garrity@lahey.org" id="13"><span class="charFormat1" id="14">Katelyn.m.garrity@lahey.org</span></a></p><p id="15"><span id="16">Aesop was old robot for urology.

(kate chimes in, yeah) It’s like we just work. Others, it’s not so much. This woman Sally, she’s like (kate chimes in too) hyperfocused on (picks up a can of wipes) “these are out of date and should have been replaced” when we’ve got a bleed going on. (kate chimes in): or she’ll go in the morning and get ALL the gear she needs for all her procedures that day, and that takes forever, instead of do one procedure, then get your stuff for the next, then the next, then the next, and so on. So some teams just work.</span></p><p id="35"><span id="36">D: There’s this woman Pam, she’s going on 2 week vacation (Kate goes “oh, no!”) yeah, I know, kate – to Sweden, and she’s the one who REALLY knows cystos here, there are other women who can, you know, but really, there are some who are just better, and so while she’s gone, it’s going to be harder around here.</span></p><p id="37"><span id="38">2:07:33 PM Wishful thinking on your part – anesthesiologist. </span></p><p id="39"><span id="40">2:07:48 PM jr resident comes in, medical students</span></p><p id="41"><span id="42">2:08:49 PM Danielle – checking on antibiotics.
