Older shitty robot, harder to manage, breaks down, so it causes some stress to deal to begin with, different equipment.</span></p><p id="5"><span id="6">So routinely, we use room 17. So that stuff still comes up even if the robot’s in 22, but now we can’t use three of those things. So we have to get the old stuff, so we have to have that old stuff hanging around, so that equipment has to come in. So there’s already redundancies, got to move that stuff. And then, people aren’t as happy because it’s the older shitty robot, surgeons are on edge, room’s on edge, and then we go from there. And always, it’s inevitable, something happens, you know, so you’re in room 22, you could have somebody that’s just, let’s say not Caitlin and René, it’s not going to go as smooth. It just won’t. Is that from a personality standpoint? Comfort level? There’s a bunch of different factors.</span></p><p id="7"><span id="8">We have stuff up here that we take the old stuff and come over, there’s like a different tray of instruments, that’s a different drape pack, you need an extra monitor drape and us that cover, so it’s like for things, five things because of this other pack of tools that you need him so we all know that now so it’s all readily available, outside of 17 on a rollaway cart type thing, so they just roll a cart outside say 22.</span></p><p id="9"><span id="10">It’s a million-dollar piece of equipment, and it’s heavy as hell, so the guys move it. So now take that same old shitty robot and put it in 12, it’s tough. Don’t have mounted monitors, Seok but more equipment in the room, take out other stuff and tables, it’s a transplant room, so it’s just a lot more moving, and then there’s wires everywhere, it’s not set up, it’s not ideal. Everybody’s upset. </span></p><p id="11"><span id="12">The second robot should be stationary, to be honest, it should be in OR 22.</span></p><p id="13"><span id="14">It’s down to skill. The skill. Canes was a resident. Phenomenal resident. He just had it, he was like Turk. He was just that good, laparoscopically. So he was great.</span></p><p id="15"><br id="16"/></p></body></html>
