Head of surgery is a colorectal surgeon. Might want to make sure her boys get the good robot. That’s speculation.</span></p><p id="3"><span id="4">They claim to need certain tools that are only available on that robot.</span></p><p id="5"><span id="6">Say they’re not trained on the other one. They never did cases on the old one. </span></p><p id="7"><span id="8">Some of it is complacency on my part and Moinzadeh’s part. We don’t like this, but we’re like, we have to choose our battles and we’re exasperated with upper management. I can throw a fit or just suck it up. I just suck it up. </span></p><p id="9"><span id="10">I’m surprised it’s increasing. I didn’t feel that increase. Part of me is like, are they sneaking this in. Are they looking at my schedule and masterminding this? </span></p><p id="11"><span id="12">I think that blocktime is politically fixed, actually to get people to relinquish block time is almost impossible. It may ideally be a certain way, but then it evolves into something different. At a certain point they changed the schedule they told me they were taking away one of my 17 blocks and changing it to a room 22 block. I think it was Pat Roberts or Steve Demers. And I said but my utilization is high, and they had some way of looking at it where they said “no, you know, colorectal’s utilization is 150%, they need some room 17 time” and I told you this, the way they tabulate [achieve this] is they run long cases. In this very unfair way of looking at utilization, it looked like I was utilizing less than they were, and justified taking away some of my room 17 and making it room 22 time. And, so that’s how some of this happens, boom, gone. And I protested and said, you know, stomped my feet and said this is unfair and then I got the sense that the decision was made and they weren’t going to budge, and I had no recourse.</span></p><p id="13"><span id="14">I don’t know who first started it [the idea that utilization equal time in the OR], but at every opportunity Moinzadeh and I have said “this is not fair, you know, I can make my utilization… utilization should be number of major cases done on a day or something, you know, not how fast I do it.” So you are actually penalized for being faster than, you know, if you’re done by four [pm], you’re utilizing 80%. That’s crazy, I said “how can you reward inefficiency that way?” [When I asked the question, they said] “this is how we have agreed to…” It’s not a clear answer, it’s an administrative smokescreen, it’s not answer. “Any technique has certain flaws, but this is how we chosen to do it,” some runaround type answer. </span></p><p id="15"><span id="16">Much as I can tell from a distance, Departments fight with each other, “we’re the busiest service know we need more block time, know we’re the busiest service we need more blocktime” and they fight with each other, and you get blocktime and you don’t want to give it up. </span></p><p id="17"><span id="18">[How do you fight for blocktime] that’s above my pay grade, Chairman to Chairman kind of deal. All this stuff happens at a chair level when a new persons hired and they get new blocktime and sometimes when someone is hired still say there is no block time you need to do cases as add-ons and once you have more volume will figure out your blocktime. It’s a mess. It’s a big mess. In this case, they put it out there that says that colorectal surgery is reaching 120% of their block time and they need more, you know. That’s how it’s done.</span></p><p id="19"><span id="20">So if I talk to them and I say &quot;you are penalizing efficiency&quot; they turn around and they say &quot;you know, I see what you're saying but we need to use this robot like it's an MRI. Or any other prize technology, and we need it running as many hours in the day as possible. So if you finish that quickly we need to have another case to follow.&quot; And then I’ll point out things like “well, you know, it’s not smart to start the case at 4:30 PM when the team is not there anymore, and the night shift comes in, and those aren’t our nurses, and all the stuff we’ve been talking about for a year, how the cohesiveness and experience of the team is really important,” I’m just making this up but they probably think well Canes wants to leave early. But really, you know the robot is not like an MRI or a microscope that needs to be run. It’s not an apt comparison completely. Yes it’s an expensive piece of technology and you want it to be used as much as possible, but it is also a little bit more complicated because you got a have a team, and experienced team doing it and once you start pushing it into after-hours you won’t get the same outcomes, I don’t think.</span></p><p id="21"><span id="22">The other thing is that, then it starts to become, well what do we want to be at Lahey. There are places that do three or four robotic prostates a day, is that the commonplace we want to be, or are we supposed to be teaching people how to do surgery here too, so that it becomes, okay are we try to set this up like a robot factory, or are we also try to do a good job teaching and there’s a lot of things going on, so if I do two cases in a day, I can do a good job teaching I can do a good case for the patient and I can get it done in a reasonable period of time, sometimes I do it fast and get out of four, and you think that’s underutilization, but do we want two rooms running at once and want me going back and forth, but Lahey doesn’t allow that. It’s a complicated thing. When Turk was here, he used to run into the same issue, he was so fast he would get penalized, and he would get all our time taken away from him, and he, so it was a battle.</span></p><p class="paraFormat1" id="23"><span id="24">Me: Another level of irony is that the people who are best positioned to teach, and that you would want to be doing that, if in fact that’s part of the mission here, are getting relegated to the robot that makes this the hardest.</span></p><p id="25"><span id="26">If you’re running a business, though, as much as you say you want to have teaching happening, you don’t really care. How much does Steve really care about teaching? Not much. And I can understand that.</span></p><p class="paraFormat1" id="27"><span id="28">Me: if it’s in fact distributed that way, then what we have his here is a top-performing organization that yet, when you pop the hood and you look inside, people who account for a wildly disproportionate amount of the value delivered and gains for the organization are pointed towards troubled spots to, yes they are most competent to deal with them.</span></p><p id="29"><span id="30">That must be what they think, right? Or they haven’t thought through it. </span></p><p id="31"><span id="32">Who can handle that robot, the new guy or the guy you already know who knows how to do it really well. It is true, I can handle room 22 and so can Ali, better than, I mean, we can muscle our way through [procedures], it is true.</span></p><p class="paraFormat1" id="33"><span id="34">Are you better off doing that and then allowing some other subspecialties to start to develop their practice, in 17 and so on, or are you clipping the wings of the organization</span></p><p id="35"><span id="36">Yeah, it’s hard to say because I think the more people in this institution that are talented at robotics across disciplines, the better it is for everyone. It should be the case.</span></p><p id="37"><span id="38">It trickles down right into my clinic, today on seeing, if I could design what Dr. canes should spend his time doing clinic, I should see only people who want to sign up for surgery, and spent a lot of time with those people. Spend an hour and a half with them with each patient. 12 patients. 12 patients who are only here because they want to have surgery. Instead, because were all treated similarly, I’ll dwell this neurologic stuff and achy testicles and blood in the urine, you see 25 people and a surgical person comes in, Russia little bit and then people are waiting for me, you know so you know, ideally say all right, here’s the talent in the institution and help keep it [maximized]. </span></p><p id="39"><br id="40"/></p></body></html>
