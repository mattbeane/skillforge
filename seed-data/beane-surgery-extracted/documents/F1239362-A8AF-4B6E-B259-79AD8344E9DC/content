Men worried about side effect. Tats what made it into a billion dollar company. Allalong we’ve been hesitaten, marketing – lotof places, where it was an arms race, we have it, they’d put up billboards, the bishop has blessed the machine. Americans in love with technology or what, so anyway, mgh, we were very slow to adopt it, I was the one who convinced them that we had to have it. or we were going to look totally stupid, we still only have one machine, normally we’d have 4-5 machines and they’d be running nonstop, bunch of serveics using it.</span></p><p id="3"><br id="4"/></p><p id="5"><span id="6">I was a patient at a cardiac procedure, bought it for another procedure, nobody’s used it for years, lot of hospitals who bough it, and forced urologists to use it. their marketing decided we’re going to move into gyn next. If you look at their marketing decisions, then the next years of medical meetings, suddenly there’s tons of abstracts about using the machine in gyn surgery, more pushed by company than necessarily surgeons finding it useful. A couple of our gyn were enthusiastic, and are now much less enthusiastic. Very few evangelists here. My perspective from st lake Utah, I’m farily sensitized to this idea, for a lot of leaders in urology, if you questioned use of robot it was heresy, people were so fanatically invested in this thing you can’t skeptically evaluate it in the treatment of the disease, it literally peple would look at you like a heretica. </span></p><p id="7"><br id="8"/></p><p id="9"><span id="10">Their marketing – their standard marketing thing was we’ll help you market your hospital, you get 50k worth of marketing for your hospital, that was the standard thing 7 years ago, also included press releases to media that was part of the package, so clearly designed to be a program, and buying yourself a big media ticket, a  lot of hospitals iddn’t put it through their tyrpical budgeting, they bought it through marketing department. Technically it’s a not robot, -it’s not a robot right, a lot of patients somehow have it in mind that – the airbrush plaine that can fly itself that it really don’t need a pilot, some technology is better than human – somehow they think that it has a brain that’s stopping surgeon from committing error. Fancy virtual reality activator or whatever you call it. obviously very sophisticated technology obviously – we eventually had to hire (and other places0 we hired someone to be the tech for the machine, a lot of people have specialized assistants because surgeon is sitting in corner, never seen anyone – it’s just because it’s kind of sacre and big and new – tech in the or is kind of interesting anyway, I do a lot of tech stuff, most people become nurses because they’re caring people, and now what they’ve become is technicians, they spend a ton of time turning on this machine turning ths on that on, and they have to become pretty knowledgable aboutour techn rather than nursing and caring, and this robot needs lots of technical expertise.
