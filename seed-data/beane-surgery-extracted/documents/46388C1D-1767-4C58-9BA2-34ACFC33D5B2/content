So the setup is always the same, you just kind of have to move the arms where you need them. When we put the old robot in 21 or 22, you basically have to reconnect everything, like the wires from the robot to the cart, from the cart to the arms, you have to set up everything from scratch, so that takes time.</span></p><p id="5"><span id="6">Then you have to rearrange the room more, because it’s not a robotic room, it’s a laparoscopic room, the other services don’t use the robot, so we have to take all our stuff out, put all our stuff in, they try to do a lot of it at night, but not everything gets done, and sometimes it doesn’t get done correctly, because they’re not robotic personnel, so they don’t really know, they just try to do the best they can.</span></p><p id="7"><span id="8">The system too, in OR 17, its much newer, all this calibrating, you need the nurse to plug in the light, you know, white set up, in OR 17 system, you can do it on your own. the handpiece on the camera handpiece, the nurse just has to plug everything in and turn it on, and you can do everything right from your camera, it has the gadgets for it. The old system doesn’t, so the nurse has to be available to push all the buttons for you so you can calibrate the scope, do the white balance, so that part of it takes time [and cooperation].  </span></p><p id="9"><span id="10">Calibrating: </span></p><p id="11"><span id="12">Unique:</span></p><p id="13"><span id="14">I check the arms, because I don’t know what it is with the old robot but the arms are not, I don’t know if they’re like old, and they just don’t move as easily as the newer robot, so they are always finagling pushing the trochars up and down, moving the arms and I’ll get up to make sure it’s not pressing on the patient’s skin I mean, you know the patient’s feet and stuff like that or any part of the body. Because I don’t want my patient to get hurt. and if you move the robot you know if you pushing something in or readjusting it when the patient is already positioned, you can’t tell if you’re scrubbed in if you’re putting pressure on the patient anywhere, you just can’t. In my nursing practice, I would get up and make sure that it’s not any, you not putting any more or any less pressure than what they should be. On that particular area that they’ve moved. This just doesn’t happen as often in 17. I don’t know why, but it just doesn’t. It usually goes much smoother because the system is so much newer. A lot of the stuff you can do on your own, it kind of bypasses, to need that extra person every second every time you do something.</span></p><p id="15"><span id="16">So instead of running back and forth If I’m the circulating nurse, I’m going to go down to OR 17 before the case and grab an extra hemolock an extra scissors and an extra bipolar, so in case it expired or it’s not working, I have it in my room. But potentially it wouldn’t be there, it wouldn’t be outside the door, and those are general surgery rooms. </span></p><p id="17"><span id="18">The positioning equipment, a lot of the nurses who don’t do the cases, and who work at night, it’s always wrong. We have to go fishing to get positioning equipment. Doing a kidney, there are certain lateral supports we use, certain positioning devices for the flank, depending on the patient, certain devices, and somebody didn’t pick it, and you’re searching the whole OR to get it, because we’re in OR 21 or 22 and they  don’t have the positioning equipment there, and I have to go find it because there’s only one set in OR 17. Sometimes there’s extra equipment in X’s area, sometimes instead of leaving it in OR 17, they move it [there]. That takes a few minutes in the morning.</span></p><p id="19"><span id="20">There’s always an issue with the scope, where it’s blurry or not aligning properly, so will have to readjust it. So I’ll have to get the scope aligned with the resident. Just stuff like that, or, you know </span></p><p id="21"><span id="22">After, I will tell you that it’s a bigger pain in the butt, because the robot has to- if we don’t have a case, if the next day we don’t have another robotic case, we have to pick up the robotic room. So we have to basically take our equipment out. You know where we can looking at the support techs, if they can wrap up all the cords which is the biggest pain in the butt for me and like I have to get the cords back with a go, roll them up neatly, put it back on the cart, you know put everything back together, and then we can have the support techs take it out and put it in storage. So because we don’t have a second robotic room, this is what they have to do, every time: to do a case you have to bring it in, and the nurse set that up, and then at the end we take it down and they take it out of the room. So, that’s another, that to me is the worst because I also work night shift, and I have to do with it both ends, have to put it all together, and take it down.</span></p><p id="23"><span id="24">It is [easy for it to go , out of calibration], and I think that’s why the older robot is even worse because you don’t know what – you have different people managing it all the time in the room and out of the room, like you don’t know what’s happening, what they hit, what it goes through in transfer. You don’t know. </span></p><p id="25"><br id="26"/></p></body></html>
