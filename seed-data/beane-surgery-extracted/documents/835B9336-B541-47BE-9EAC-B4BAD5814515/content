Because technically if an issue is going to happen with the robot, 99% of the time, the injury is going to occur in the beginning stage with the robot, upon docking, or prior to docking, on the insertion of the trochars. That’s when they hit the iliac artery, that’s when they hit the aorta, that’s when all the injuries occur, 99% of the time. So once the robot is docked, it’s usually okay.</span></p><p id="5"><span id="6">So the surgeon is trying to do a lymph node dissection – GYN surgeons usually - trying to do a lymph node dissection they’re sitting right around that iliac artery – they nick that artery. You have to undock within 30 seconds or you have to be able to suture it. There’s not a lot of suturing in GYN. So that’s why most studies tend to be done on urology side or a cardiac side.</span></p><p id="7"><span id="8">But the bonus in the savings is still there is lower infection rate, you know with the chances, you’re less likely for a UTI, and they’re going home the next day. We figure as many as we do, it’s less likely of us looking for ever in most hospitals you’re seeing “we need bids, please discharge outpatients, discharge whatever patient you can as long as they’re good.” So, now, my patient goes home the next day. So we get paid the same, whether the patient stays one day or three days. So yeah, we’re taking that $2000 cost, but we’re saving on nursing up on the floors, the bed that’s available and other things. And, it’s just a market-driven thing. Patients want this.</span></p><p id="9"><span id="10">When I had to do the robot I went through all the marketing, I went to every aspect of it to see. But the thing is if you have something that can get you home in one day as opposed to three days, or the average person especially females, females make a lot of the decisions, believe it or not, about the medical care in a family, so, especially females now, if I was going to have surgery, I am a single mother with two kids. Am I going to have a surgeon that’s going put me out of work for six weeks or put me in the hospital for three days, or am I going to have one where I can potentially go home the same day, and be back to work in two weeks? I don’t have the downtime that’s available for that. So as many negative comments as you may hear on the robot lately, it still doesn’t cover all the benefits.</span></p><p id="11"><span id="12">They [small hospitals] have a robot. Almost everybody has one, that’s the issue with it. Some hospitals put it in a coat closet, because people want it for their, they buy it because that’s what their patients want. They get it, but then the staff is trained, or the doctor doesn’t like it, or he doesn’t have enough patients, or doesn’t have enough patience, or doesn’t want to do it, there’s multiple. But they still buy it.</span></p></body></html>
