Interesting that they used the robot for only about 45% of the procedure, and very interesting that the scrub – D – really didn’t go for it – it stressed her out. I need to follow up with her. I think what I just watched was a case in which the use of the tech is not exactly 100% high-need – borderline case – in which they’re opting to use the tech for only part of the procedure – a part that is relatively safe and predictable – in order to get practice using it in order to prepare for a big time deal. </span></p><p id="5"><span id="6">Also took big note of signage developed by S “to help folks when I’m out on vacation” she said. Interesting, from the rep, that these signs show up in every site he’s worked at. Sorcini has a procedure next week on the single console, going to try for that. </span></p><p id="7"><span id="8"> </span></p></body></html>
