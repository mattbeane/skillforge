# Technology and Learning in Robotic Surgery: A Theory of Mediated Skill Transfer

## Abstract

We develop and test a theory of how technology mediates skill transfer in surgical training. Drawing on organizational learning theory and technology studies, we hypothesize that robotic surgery systems create barriers to traditional apprenticeship models. Using ethnographic data from surgical observations, we find support for three propositions: (1) robotic interfaces reduce trainee participation, (2) trainees adapt through informal learning strategies, and (3) workarounds maintain system performance. Our findings extend organizational learning theory by showing how technology can simultaneously improve performance and degrade skill transfer. We conclude with implications for managing technology-mediated work.

## Introduction

Technology transforms work. Nowhere is this more evident than in surgery, where robotic systems have revolutionized procedural capabilities. The da Vinci surgical robot enables minimally invasive procedures with unprecedented precision, benefiting patients through reduced recovery times and improved outcomes.

Yet technology has unintended consequences. Prior research suggests that technology can disrupt established work practices and learning routines (Barley, 1986; Orlikowski, 2000). When technology changes how experts perform work, it may also change how novices learn that work. This creates a puzzle: how do organizations maintain skill transfer when technology reconfigures the work being transferred?

We address this question through an ethnographic study of robotic surgery training. Based on organizational learning theory (March, 1991; Levitt & March, 1988), we predict that technology-mediated work will reduce opportunities for legitimate peripheral participation (Lave & Wenger, 1991), forcing trainees to develop alternative learning strategies. Our data confirm this prediction: residents in robotic surgery receive dramatically less hands-on practice than in traditional open surgery, and successful learners compensate through informal, sometimes norm-challenging practices.

This paper makes three contributions. First, we test and extend organizational learning theory to technology-mediated contexts. Second, we provide the first systematic documentation of learning barriers in robotic surgery. Third, we offer practical guidance for surgical training programs adapting to technological change.

The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows. We first develop our theoretical framework and derive hypotheses. We then describe our methods and present findings. We conclude with a discussion of implications and limitations.

## Theoretical Framework and Hypotheses

### Technology and Organizational Learning

Organizations learn through routines (Nelson & Winter, 1982). When technology changes, routines must adapt. March's (1991) exploration-exploitation framework suggests that organizations face tradeoffs between refining existing practices and developing new ones. Technology adoption may disrupt this balance by making established learning routines obsolete.

Legitimate peripheral participation theory (Lave & Wenger, 1991) describes how novices learn through gradual involvement in expert work. Newcomers begin at the periphery, performing simple tasks, and progressively move toward fuller participation as they develop competence. This model assumes that expert work is accessible to novices—they can observe, assist, and eventually perform core tasks under supervision.

### Technology as Participation Barrier

Robotic surgery may undermine legitimate peripheral participation. Unlike open surgery, where multiple surgeons can physically manipulate tissue simultaneously, robotic surgery concentrates control at a single console. The primary surgeon operates the robotic arms; assistants are limited to tasks the robot cannot perform. This reconfigures the participation gradient that enables skill transfer.

**Hypothesis 1:** Robotic surgery reduces trainee participation compared to open surgery.

### Adaptive Learning Strategies

When legitimate means fail, learners adapt. Research on workarounds (Alter, 2014) shows that workers develop informal strategies to accomplish goals that formal systems impede. We expect trainees facing participation barriers to develop alternative learning strategies that may challenge official norms.

**Hypothesis 2:** Trainees develop informal learning strategies to compensate for reduced participation.

### Workarounds and System Performance

Organizations maintain performance through workarounds (Orr, 1996). When experienced workers encounter system problems, they develop coping strategies that preserve outcomes while masking underlying issues. This creates a paradox: workarounds enable short-term success while potentially preventing long-term improvement.

**Hypothesis 3:** Experienced workers develop workarounds that maintain performance while masking technology problems.

## Methods

### Research Design

We conducted an ethnographic study of surgical training at a major teaching hospital. Our design enabled deep observation of learning practices in context.

### Data Collection

We observed 47 surgical procedures over 18 months, including both robotic and open surgeries. Observations were recorded in detailed field notes. We also conducted 23 semi-structured interviews with surgeons, residents, and surgical staff.

### Data Analysis

We analyzed data using grounded theory methods (Glaser & Strauss, 1967). Open coding identified initial themes; axial coding organized themes into categories; selective coding integrated categories into theoretical propositions. NVivo software facilitated systematic analysis.

### Sample Characteristics

Our sample included 12 attending surgeons, 8 surgical residents, and 3 surgical fellows. Procedures observed included prostatectomies, nephrectomies, and other urological surgeries.

## Findings

### Finding 1: Technology Reduces Participation (H1 Supported)

Our data strongly support Hypothesis 1. Residents in robotic surgery spent dramatically less time performing surgical tasks compared to open surgery. As one attending surgeon explained:

> "The resident is basically the sucker. They're there to suction fluids and hand me things. In open surgery, we're working together—four hands on the patient. With the robot, I'm doing everything from the console."

Quantitative analysis of our observation data confirmed this pattern. In open surgical procedures, residents performed hands-on surgical work for an average of 78% of procedure time. In robotic procedures, this dropped to approximately 8%.

The technology created physical separation between expert and novice. One resident described the experience:

> "You're standing there watching a screen. The attending is across the room at the console. You can see what's happening, but you can't feel anything. And when they do let you on the console, they're watching every move you make."

### Finding 2: Informal Learning Strategies (H2 Supported)

Residents developed three informal strategies to compensate for reduced participation:

**Strategy 1: Simulation Practice.** Residents spent significant personal time on surgical simulators, practicing techniques they couldn't practice on patients. As one resident explained:

> "I've probably spent 200 hours on the simulator. That's the only way I can get reps. You can't learn surgery by watching—you have to do it. So I do it on the sim."

**Strategy 2: Video Learning.** Residents watched YouTube videos of surgical procedures, studying techniques they couldn't practice directly. This represents a shift from embodied to vicarious learning.

**Strategy 3: Opportunistic Practice.** When supervising surgeons were briefly distracted or stepped away, some residents would practice maneuvers independently. One resident admitted:

> "Don't tell anyone I said this, but sometimes when the attending is talking to anesthesia or whatever, I'll try a few moves on my own. It's the only way to actually feel what it's like."

These strategies enabled learning but operated outside official training protocols.

### Finding 3: Workarounds Maintain Performance (H3 Supported)

Experienced staff developed workarounds to maintain performance despite technology problems. The hospital operated two surgical robots—a newer model for high-volume procedures and an older model assigned to less complex cases. Staff assigned to the older robot developed extensive coping strategies:

> "This thing is held together with duct tape and prayers. The camera drifts, the instruments are worn out, the software crashes. But we make it work because the patients still need surgery."

These workarounds were technically effective but created hidden costs. One circulating nurse explained the frustration:

> "Every case is a battle. We jerry-rig solutions, we improvise, we make do. And at the end of the day, the patient is fine. But management doesn't see what we went through."

The "venting cycle" emerged as a key pattern. Staff would express frustration to supervisors, who would acknowledge concerns but rarely allocate resources for fixes. The cycle repeated: vent, acknowledge, continue. As one technician noted:

> "We complain, they listen, nothing changes. So we keep complaining and keep making it work. It's exhausting but what else can we do?"

## Discussion

### Theoretical Implications

Our findings confirm and extend organizational learning theory. Technology can simultaneously enhance performance and degrade skill transfer—a paradox not fully addressed in prior literature. The concept of "mediated participation barriers" helps explain how technology designed for efficiency may inadvertently undermine learning.

We also contribute to workaround literature by documenting the "venting cycle"—a mechanism through which organizations acknowledge problems without addressing them. This extends Orr's (1996) work on informal coping strategies.

### Practical Implications

Our findings have significant implications for surgical training:

1. **Simulation integration:** Training programs should formally incorporate simulation as a complement to operating room experience.
2. **Dual-console systems:** Investing in training-friendly technology may preserve skill transfer.
3. **Workaround management:** Organizations should recognize the hidden costs of workaround labor and invest in system maintenance.

### Limitations

This study has limitations characteristic of ethnographic research. Our sample was limited to one teaching hospital; patterns may differ elsewhere. We relied on observation and interview data; direct measurement of skill acquisition would strengthen causal claims. Future research should examine these dynamics across multiple institutions.

### Conclusion

Technology transforms not only how work is done but how it is learned. As robotic systems proliferate across industries, organizations must attend to their effects on skill transfer. Our theory of mediated participation barriers provides a framework for understanding these dynamics and designing interventions to preserve learning in technology-intensive work.
