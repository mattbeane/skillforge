## Section A: Multiple Choice (10 questions)

### Question 1
You have evidence that shadow learning enables surgical trainees to acquire skill. Your first framing attempts position this as "a new way trainees learn." A colleague says this framing is weak. Why?

- a) It's not novel enough
- b) It doesn't specify the scope or conditions
- c) It's descriptive rather than explanatory—it doesn't illuminate WHEN or WHY this happens
- d) It needs more hedging

**Correct**: c
**Why**: "A new way trainees learn" is descriptive. Strong framing explains the conditions under which this occurs (when legitimate participation fails) and why (technology concentrates control). The mechanism matters more than the phenomenon.

---

### Question 2
According to Zuckerman's framing criteria, a contribution should meet which standard?

- a) Novel + True + Interesting
- b) Novel + True + Important + Reachable
- c) Surprising + Rigorous + Well-written
- d) Theoretical + Empirical + Methodological

**Correct**: b
**Why**: Zuckerman's criteria: Novel (not already known), True (evidence supports it), Important (matters to the conversation), Reachable (audience can understand and engage with it). All four must hold.

---

### Question 3
A researcher frames their finding as: "Technology affects work." This violates which framing principle?

- a) Novelty—everyone knows this
- b) Specificity—it doesn't say HOW technology affects work, under what conditions, or with what consequences
- c) Truth—it may not be accurate
- d) Importance—no one cares about technology

**Correct**: b
**Why**: The framing is too vague to be a contribution. Strong framing specifies the mechanism, boundary conditions, and consequences. "Technology affects work" is a topic, not a theoretical claim.

---

### Question 4
You're framing a paper about how experienced workers maintain outcomes on degrading technology. Which title is strongest?

- a) "Workarounds in Healthcare Technology"
- b) "How Organizations Maintain Performance on Degrading Systems"
- c) "When Experienced Workers Compensate for Technology Degradation: The Hidden Costs of Portfolio Management"
- d) "A Study of Surgical Robots"

**Correct**: c
**Why**: (c) specifies who (experienced workers), what (compensate for degradation), and signals the insight (hidden costs). It frames the puzzle (how is performance maintained?) and hints at the theoretical contribution (portfolio management creates invisible costs).

---

### Question 5
A reviewer says your framing "buries the lead." What does this mean?

- a) Your conclusion is wrong
- b) Your most important insight comes too late—readers don't see the contribution early enough
- c) You have too many findings
- d) Your literature review is too long

**Correct**: b
**Why**: "Burying the lead" means the key contribution isn't foregrounded. Readers should understand the paper's importance in the first few paragraphs. If the most important insight appears on page 20, you've buried it.

---

### Question 6
Strong theoretical framing requires generating multiple candidate frames. Why?

- a) Reviewers want to see you considered alternatives
- b) It demonstrates thoroughness
- c) The first frame you generate is rarely the strongest—iteration reveals better options
- d) It increases word count

**Correct**: c
**Why**: Framing is creative work. Your first instinct is often descriptive or too narrow. Generating 3-5 alternative frames, comparing their strengths, and selecting (or synthesizing) yields stronger positioning.

---

### Question 7
Your finding is that trainees learn through "undersupervised struggle" when legitimate supervision fails. A colleague suggests framing this as "a critique of medical education." What's wrong with this framing?

- a) It's not critical enough
- b) Critique is normative, not theoretical—it doesn't explain the mechanism or speak to scholarly conversations
- c) Medical education is too narrow
- d) Nothing is wrong with it

**Correct**: b
**Why**: Critique tells the world something is bad. Theoretical framing explains how and why something works. "This is broken" isn't a contribution; "Here's the mechanism by which technology disrupts skill transfer" is.

---

### Question 8
The "Goldilocks zone" for theoretical claims means:

- a) Claims should be moderately long
- b) Claims should be specific enough to be testable but general enough to matter beyond one case
- c) Claims should appeal to moderate reviewers
- d) Claims should be neither positive nor negative

**Correct**: b
**Why**: Too specific ("at this hospital, in robotic urology, during 2015...") and your claim only applies to one context. Too general ("technology changes work") and it's trivially true. The Goldilocks zone: bounded but generalizable.

---

### Question 9
A researcher has three possible frames for the same finding:

1. "Shadow learning is how trainees survive robotic surgery programs"
2. "When legitimate participation fails, learners develop alternative practices that communities tacitly tolerate"
3. "Surgical training is worse with robots"

Which is the strongest theoretical frame?

- a) Frame 1—it's concrete and specific
- b) Frame 2—it identifies mechanism and scope conditions, applies beyond surgery
- c) Frame 3—it makes a clear normative claim
- d) They're all equally strong

**Correct**: b
**Why**: Frame 2 identifies the mechanism (alternative practices emerge), the condition (when legitimate participation fails), and the social process (tacit tolerance). It applies to any community where participation structures break down—not just surgery.

---

### Question 10
A strong frame should make readers think:

- a) "That's obviously true—why didn't someone say this before?"
- b) "That's interesting, but I'm not sure I believe it"
- c) "That's surprising but plausible, and it changes how I think about X"
- d) "That's what I expected to find"

**Correct**: c
**Why**: The best contributions are surprising enough to matter but plausible enough to be believed. If it's obvious, it's not novel. If it's unbelievable, it won't be accepted. The sweet spot: "I hadn't thought of it that way, but now I can't unsee it."

## Section B: Short Answer (2 questions)

### Question 11
You have evidence that shadow learning (norm-challenging, isolated practices) enables skill acquisition when formal training fails. Generate THREE alternative theoretical frames for this finding, and identify which is strongest and why.

**Model answer should include 3 frames such as**:
- Frame A: "Alternative learning pathways emerge when technology disrupts legitimate peripheral participation"
- Frame B: "Communities tacitly tolerate norm violations that compensate for structural failures"
- Frame C: "Skill acquisition under participation constraints requires practices that learners know are problematic"
- Strongest frame: Should identify one that (1) specifies mechanism, (2) generalizes beyond surgery, (3) speaks to existing theory (e.g., communities of practice, organizational tolerance)
- Reasoning: Should explain why that frame has broader reach or more theoretical purchase

---

### Question 12
A researcher frames their paper: "We contribute to the literature on technology and work by showing that robots affect surgical training."

Identify TWO specific problems with this framing and rewrite it to be stronger.

**Model answer should include**:
- Problem 1: "Contribute to the literature on X" is not a contribution claim—doesn't say what changes
- Problem 2: "Robots affect training" is vague—doesn't specify how, through what mechanism, under what conditions
- Rewrite example: "We extend communities of practice theory by showing that technologies which concentrate control at expert-operated interfaces eliminate the participation gradient that enables skill transfer—forcing learners into alternative practices that communities tacitly tolerate but cannot officially sanction."
- Key elements in rewrite: Specific theory engaged, mechanism identified, boundary conditions implied, consequence specified
