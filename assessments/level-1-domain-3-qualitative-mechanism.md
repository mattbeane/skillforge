## Section A: Multiple Choice (10 questions)

### Question 1
Before reading interview data about how surgical residents learn, a researcher should:

- a) Have an open mind and see what emerges from the data
- b) Generate specific hypotheses about what mechanisms might operate (e.g., "If shadow learning exists, I should see evidence of unsanctioned practice")
- c) Read the literature until they know exactly what they'll find
- d) Let a research assistant do initial coding without any framing

**Correct**: b
**Why**: Hypotheses create searchable predictions and guard against confirmation bias. "Open mind" often means finding whatever you want to find.

---

### Question 2
A researcher codes 10 interviews and finds that 8 support their proposed mechanism while 2 describe the opposite experience. What should they do?

- a) Report only the 8 supporting informants—they're the majority
- b) Investigate why the 2 differ—they might reveal a boundary condition or alternative mechanism
- c) Recode the 2 interviews more carefully to find supporting evidence
- d) Conclude the mechanism is "mostly supported" and move on

**Correct**: b
**Why**: Disconfirming cases often reveal the most interesting theoretical insight. The exceptions might define scope conditions or suggest an alternative mechanism at play.

---

### Question 3
Which coding approach is most appropriate for mechanism extraction?

- a) Read each interview and note interesting themes as they emerge
- b) Code all interviews against a pre-defined set of mechanism hypotheses, then look for patterns
- c) Find 5-10 good quotes that support the main finding
- d) Have different research assistants code different interviews

**Correct**: b
**Why**: Systematic coding with explicit criteria, applied consistently across ALL data. Theme emergence without structure invites confirmation bias.

---

### Question 4
A researcher studying shadow learning finds the following quote: "I practiced on YouTube at home because I knew I'd never get real console time." Which coding represents good practice?

- a) Code: "Learning" — captures the topic
- b) Code: "Abstract rehearsal" — captures the specific norm-challenging practice
- c) Code: "Trainee frustration" — captures the emotion
- d) Code: "Technology" — captures the medium

**Correct**: b
**Why**: Good codes capture action/process, not just topics. "Abstract rehearsal" is a mechanism; "Learning" is too vague to illuminate how learning happens outside approved channels.

---

### Question 5
You're studying why some surgical residents succeed while others don't. You notice that successful residents all mention practicing at night or on weekends. What's your next move?

- a) Report this as evidence that hard work leads to success
- b) Check whether UNSUCCESSFUL residents also practiced at night/weekends—if they did, it's not the explanation
- c) Select vivid quotes about weekend practice for the paper
- d) Interview more successful residents to confirm the pattern

**Correct**: b
**Why**: Confirming a pattern among successful residents isn't enough—you need to check whether the pattern distinguishes them from unsuccessful ones. Otherwise, you may be reporting something that's true of everyone, not a mechanism.

---

### Question 6
A researcher claims to have found "no disconfirming evidence" for their proposed mechanism after coding 20 interviews. What should you conclude?

- a) Their mechanism is well-supported
- b) They probably didn't look hard enough—honest coding almost always finds some disconfirming evidence
- c) Twenty interviews is enough to be confident
- d) The mechanism must be very robust

**Correct**: b
**Why**: Zero disconfirming evidence is a red flag, not a strength. Real qualitative data is messy; finding no exceptions suggests the researcher wasn't genuinely looking for them.

---

### Question 7
Which quote selection demonstrates good practice?

- a) "I chose the most eloquent quotes from senior surgeons"
- b) "I selected quotes where the mechanism is visible in action, including one that challenges my interpretation"
- c) "I found quotes that perfectly match my hypotheses"
- d) "I included memorable quotes that will engage readers"

**Correct**: b
**Why**: Illumination over illustration. Good quotes show the mechanism operating, not just smart people saying what you want to hear. Including disconfirming evidence shows intellectual honesty.

---

### Question 8
A researcher finds a quote: "Don't tell anyone I said this, but we all enter data early to save time." What makes this quote valuable for mechanism extraction?

- a) It's vivid and will engage readers
- b) It reveals a norm-challenging practice that informants know is problematic but engage in anyway—showing how hidden practices operate
- c) It's from a senior informant who should know
- d) It confirms what the researcher expected to find

**Correct**: b
**Why**: The "don't tell anyone" signals that this is a shadow practice—something done outside sanctioned channels. This illuminates how work actually happens vs. how it's supposed to happen.

---

### Question 9
You're coding interviews about surgical learning. You notice informants talk about "helicopter teaching" where the attending constantly interrupts with verbal corrections. How should you code this?

- a) "Teaching" — that's the general topic
- b) "Feedback" — that's what's happening
- c) "Helicopter teaching" or "verbal micromanagement" — an in-vivo code that captures what informants actually describe
- d) "Supervision" — the official category

**Correct**: c
**Why**: In-vivo codes (using informants' own language or evocative descriptions) preserve the phenomenon as participants experience it. "Teaching" loses the crucial quality that makes this form of instruction problematic for learning.

---

### Question 10
A researcher finds strong mechanism evidence in 12 of 15 interviews. The 3 exceptions are all from one hospital. What's the best interpretation?

- a) The mechanism is well-supported (12/15 = 80%)
- b) The 3 exceptions are outliers that can be ignored
- c) The clustering at one hospital suggests a boundary condition—something about that site may suppress the mechanism
- d) The researcher should recode those 3 interviews

**Correct**: c
**Why**: Clustering of exceptions isn't random noise—it signals something systematic. Understanding WHY one hospital doesn't show the pattern could reveal important scope conditions or alternative mechanisms.

## Section B: Short Answer (2 questions)

### Question 11
A researcher studying surgical training finds the following codes in their data: "Teaching," "Learning," "Training," "Technology," "Robot." What's wrong with this coding scheme, and how would you improve it?

**Model answer should include**:
- These codes are too abstract—they're topics, not mechanisms
- They don't capture action/process (verbs, not nouns)
- Better codes would capture HOW learning/teaching happens: "helicopter teaching," "console delegation," "abstract rehearsal," "undersupervised struggle"
- Good codes reveal relationships and processes, not just categories
- The codes should distinguish between different TYPES of teaching/learning, not just note that teaching occurs

---

### Question 12
You've coded 10 interviews for evidence of "shadow learning." You found the following distribution:

- 5 interviews: Strong evidence of shadow learning
- 3 interviews: Moderate evidence
- 2 interviews: No evidence of shadow learning

How would you report this? What additional information would you need?

**Model answer should include**:
- Report the full distribution, not just "we found evidence of shadow learning"
- Investigate the 2 without evidence: Are they different roles? Different sites? Less successful learners? This matters for scope conditions
- Consider whether the 3 "moderate" cases share characteristics
- Look for disconfirming evidence WITHIN the 5 strong cases—were there times when shadow learning didn't work?
- Need to know: What distinguishes informants who showed vs. didn't show the pattern? This reveals boundary conditions
- Avoid cherry-picking only the 5 strong cases for quotes
