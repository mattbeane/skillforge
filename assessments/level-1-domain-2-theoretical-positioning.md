## Section A: Multiple Choice (10 questions)

### Question 1
A researcher finds that surgical trainees get less hands-on time with robotic surgery than open surgery. Which positioning question should they ask FIRST?

- a) "How can I publish this in ASQ?"
- b) "What theory explains this pattern?"
- c) "What conversation does this finding speak to—and what would it change?"
- d) "What data do I need to prove causation?"

**Correct**: c
**Why**: Before selecting theory, identify the conversation you're entering. A finding can speak to multiple literatures; the contribution depends on which one you join and what you'd change about it.

---

### Question 2
A researcher discovers that experienced workers develop workarounds to compensate for degrading technology. Which framing positions this as the LARGEST contribution?

- a) "Experienced workers compensate for degradation" (descriptive finding)
- b) "Organizations sustain performance through worker workarounds" (mechanism)
- c) "Technology portfolios create invisible maintenance labor that masks degradation from management" (systemic insight with strategic implications)
- d) "Workarounds exist in hospitals" (empirical observation)

**Correct**: c
**Why**: The largest contribution reframes what we thought we knew. (c) reveals a hidden dynamic with strategic implications—organizations may think they're succeeding when they're actually depleting experienced talent.

---

### Question 3
A researcher has qualitative data on how surgical residents learn informally. Which literature does this finding MOST directly challenge?

- a) Communities of practice (Lave & Wenger)
- b) Organizational learning
- c) Technology adoption
- d) Professional socialization

**Correct**: a
**Why**: Communities of practice specifically theorizes that learners gain skill through legitimate peripheral participation—doing real work alongside experts. Finding that learners succeed through non-legitimate, isolated practices directly challenges this.

---

### Question 4
What distinguishes a "positioning" contribution from a "mechanism" contribution?

- a) Positioning papers are theoretical; mechanism papers are empirical
- b) Positioning papers reframe what we thought we knew; mechanism papers reveal how something works
- c) Positioning papers cite more literature; mechanism papers have more data
- d) They're the same thing with different names

**Correct**: b
**Why**: Positioning contributions change how we understand an existing conversation (e.g., "we thought X, but actually Y"). Mechanism contributions reveal the process by which something occurs (e.g., "this is HOW X happens").

---

### Question 5
A researcher proposes to frame their finding as speaking to "technology and work." A senior colleague says this is too broad. What's the better move?

- a) Narrow to a specific debate within technology and work (e.g., "how technology affects skill transfer")
- b) Add more literature streams to be comprehensive
- c) Keep it broad to appeal to more readers
- d) Focus on method instead of theory

**Correct**: a
**Why**: Contributions require specific conversations. "Technology and work" is a broad topic, not a conversation. The researcher needs to identify a specific debate where their finding would change what people believe.

---

### Question 6
You discover that shadow learning (norm-challenging, isolated practice) is how successful surgical trainees learn. Which positioning moves are appropriate?

- a) Claim you've discovered a new phenomenon
- b) Position against communities of practice—showing that learning CAN occur through non-legitimate, isolated practice
- c) Argue that all prior learning theory is wrong
- d) Present it as a descriptive case study without theoretical positioning

**Correct**: b
**Why**: Good positioning engages existing theory. You're not claiming learning theory is wrong—you're extending it by showing a boundary condition (when legitimate participation fails, alternative paths emerge).

---

### Question 7
A finding can speak to multiple literatures. How should you choose which conversation to enter?

- a) Choose the literature you know best
- b) Choose where your finding would create the largest revision to existing beliefs
- c) Choose the most prestigious journals in any literature
- d) Choose the easiest literature to publish in

**Correct**: b
**Why**: Contribution = magnitude of change to what the field believes. Position your finding where it would most significantly revise or extend current understanding.

---

### Question 8
A researcher frames their finding about workarounds as "contributing to the workarounds literature." A reviewer says this is insufficient. What's missing?

- a) More citations
- b) A claim about what their finding CHANGES about existing workaround theory
- c) A quantitative test
- d) More cases

**Correct**: b
**Why**: "Contributing to X" is not a contribution. The researcher must specify: "Prior workaround theory assumes Y; we show Z instead" or "extends workaround theory to new domain Q." The change must be explicit.

---

### Question 9
You have evidence that technology can eliminate trainee participation in work. Which of these is the strongest theoretical claim?

- a) "Technology sometimes reduces trainee participation"
- b) "Technologies that concentrate control at a single interface eliminate the participation gradient that enables skill transfer"
- c) "Robots are bad for training"
- d) "We studied a case where trainees got less experience"

**Correct**: b
**Why**: (b) identifies the general mechanism (concentrated control → eliminated participation gradient) that would apply beyond this specific case. It's bounded ("technologies that...") but generalizable.

---

### Question 10
A reviewer says your paper "reads like a solution looking for a problem." What did you do wrong?

- a) Your writing is unclear
- b) You presented findings before establishing what conversation they speak to and why it matters
- c) Your sample is too small
- d) You need more theory

**Correct**: b
**Why**: Papers must establish the intellectual problem (what gap or tension exists in current understanding) before presenting findings. Otherwise readers don't know why they should care.

---

## Section B: Short Answer (2 questions)

### Question 11
A researcher finds that experienced surgeons get assigned to older, degrading technology while newer surgeons get the latest equipment. They want to frame this as "age discrimination in technology allocation."

What's wrong with this positioning, and what alternative framing would generate a larger contribution?

**Model answer should include**:
- Age discrimination framing is descriptive and normative, not theoretical
- Doesn't connect to existing scholarly conversations about technology, organizations, or resource allocation
- Better framing: Connects to technological portfolio management, resource allocation under scarcity, or skill preservation under degradation
- Key insight: The pattern may reflect organizational rationality (protecting investment in new system) rather than discrimination
- Alternative framing example: "How organizations unintentionally stress experienced talent when managing a technological portfolio"

---

### Question 12
Your finding is that surgical trainees who succeed do so through norm-challenging practices (shadow learning). You could position this against:

A) Communities of practice theory (Lave & Wenger)
B) Organizational socialization literature
C) Technology adoption literature

For each, write ONE sentence describing what your contribution would be.

**Model answer should include**:
- A) CoP contribution: Shows that when legitimate peripheral participation is blocked by technology, learning can occur through non-legitimate practices that the community tolerates but doesn't sanction
- B) Socialization contribution: Reveals how newcomers acquire skills when formal socialization channels fail—through practices that violate rather than conform to organizational norms
- C) Technology contribution: Demonstrates how technology designed for efficiency can inadvertently block skill transfer, forcing workarounds that organizations tacitly tolerate
- Key: Each framing emphasizes different aspects of the same finding
