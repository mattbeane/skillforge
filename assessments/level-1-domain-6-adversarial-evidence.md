## Section A: Multiple Choice (10 questions)

### Question 1
You're coding interviews and find strong evidence for shadow learning in 12 of 15 cases. For the 3 cases without evidence, you should:

- a) Exclude them as outliers
- b) Investigate what's different about them—they may reveal boundary conditions or alternative mechanisms
- c) Recode them more carefully to find shadow learning
- d) Report only the 12 supporting cases

**Correct**: b
**Why**: Disconfirming cases are theoretically valuable. If 3 cases don't show the pattern, something distinguishes them. Understanding that distinction sharpens your theory and identifies scope conditions.

---

### Question 2
A researcher reports finding "no disconfirming evidence" for their mechanism. What should you conclude?

- a) Their mechanism is very robust
- b) They probably didn't look hard enough—real data almost always contains complications
- c) Their sample was homogeneous
- d) The mechanism is universal

**Correct**: b
**Why**: Zero disconfirming evidence is a red flag. Real qualitative data is messy; even strong mechanisms have boundary conditions, exceptions, or complications. No disconfirmation usually means the researcher wasn't genuinely looking.

---

### Question 3
You find a quote that seems to contradict your proposed mechanism. What's the most productive response?

- a) Exclude it from analysis
- b) Ask: "What would have to be true for this quote to coexist with my mechanism?"—it may reveal conditions under which the mechanism doesn't operate
- c) Reinterpret it to fit your mechanism
- d) Note it as an anomaly and move on

**Correct**: b
**Why**: Contradictions are opportunities. Asking what conditions would reconcile the contradiction often reveals boundary conditions, moderators, or alternative mechanisms you hadn't considered.

---

### Question 4
The "adversarial" in adversarial evidence means:

- a) Evidence that attacks your paper
- b) Evidence you actively search for that could disconfirm your interpretation
- c) Evidence presented by reviewers
- d) Evidence from competing papers

**Correct**: b
**Why**: Adversarial evidence is what YOU search for, not what others find. The discipline is actively trying to disconfirm your own interpretation before others do. It's self-imposed intellectual honesty.

---

### Question 5
Which practice demonstrates genuine adversarial evidence hunting?

- a) Waiting for reviewers to identify problems
- b) Re-reading all data specifically looking for quotes/cases that challenge your mechanism
- c) Asking a colleague if the paper seems convincing
- d) Checking that all quotes support your claims

**Correct**: b
**Why**: Genuine adversarial hunting means actively searching YOUR OWN data for challenges. It's not passive (waiting for reviewers) or confirmatory (checking that quotes support claims). It's deliberate disconfirmation-seeking.

---

### Question 6
A researcher finds their mechanism operates strongly in 8 interviews, weakly in 4, and not at all in 3. How should they report this?

- a) Report only the 8 strong cases with vivid quotes
- b) Report the full distribution and investigate what distinguishes the groups
- c) Average across all 15 and report moderate support
- d) Focus on the 8 strong cases but mention the others exist

**Correct**: b
**Why**: The distribution IS the finding. Understanding why the mechanism operates strongly vs. weakly vs. not at all reveals the conditions under which it works. Cherry-picking the strong cases misrepresents what you found.

---

### Question 7
You're analyzing data and keep finding evidence that supports your mechanism. You haven't found any disconfirming cases. This suggests:

- a) Your mechanism is correct
- b) You should actively code for disconfirmation—create codes specifically designed to capture challenges to your mechanism
- c) You've done enough analysis
- d) The data strongly supports your claims

**Correct**: b
**Why**: Finding only confirming evidence is a sign of confirmation bias, not strong evidence. You need to create adversarial codes and specifically search for patterns that would challenge your interpretation.

---

### Question 8
A colleague says "But won't showing disconfirming evidence weaken my paper?" The correct response is:

- a) Yes, so hide it
- b) No—showing you genuinely engaged with complications builds credibility and sharpens theory
- c) Yes, but reviewers require it
- d) Only include minor disconfirmations

**Correct**: b
**Why**: Papers that show only confirming evidence look naive or cherry-picked. Engaging with disconfirmation demonstrates intellectual honesty and often strengthens theory by clarifying boundary conditions.

---

### Question 9
What distinguishes "disconfirming evidence" from "limitations"?

- a) They're the same thing
- b) Disconfirming evidence challenges your interpretation of the data; limitations are methodological constraints
- c) Limitations are more serious
- d) Disconfirming evidence is optional to report

**Correct**: b
**Why**: Disconfirming evidence = cases/quotes that challenge your mechanism (theoretical challenge). Limitations = constraints on your method, sample, or context (methodological acknowledgment). Both belong in your paper, but they're different.

---

### Question 10
You discover that your mechanism doesn't operate in teaching hospitals vs. community hospitals. How should you handle this?

- a) Focus only on the hospital type where it works
- b) Present this as a boundary condition—specifying WHEN the mechanism operates
- c) Treat it as a limitation and minimize discussion
- d) Argue that community hospitals are atypical

**Correct**: b
**Why**: This IS your contribution now. The mechanism doesn't apply universally; it operates under specific conditions. "Shadow learning operates when X but not when Y" is more precise and valuable than a universal claim that doesn't hold.

---

## Section B: Short Answer (2 questions)

### Question 11
You're writing a paper on shadow learning. You've found 10 vivid quotes supporting your mechanism. Describe the process you would use to search for adversarial evidence, and give two examples of what you might look for.

**Model answer should include**:
- Process: Re-read ALL data (not just coded quotes) specifically looking for challenges
- Create adversarial codes: "counter-evidence," "mechanism absent," "alternative explanation"
- Look for cases where conditions were similar but mechanism didn't operate
- Seek quotes where informants describe the phenomenon differently than your interpretation
- Example 1: Look for successful learners who DIDN'T engage in shadow learning—what did they do instead?
- Example 2: Look for cases where shadow learning was attempted but didn't lead to skill—what went wrong?
- Example 3: Look for informants who describe their learning differently than "shadow" practices—are you imposing a frame?

---

### Question 12
A paper claims that "shadow learning enables skill acquisition in robotic surgery." The author presents 8 supporting quotes and no disconfirming evidence.

Write a brief reviewer comment (3-4 sentences) explaining why this is problematic and what the author should do.

**Model answer should include**:
- Note the absence of disconfirming evidence as a red flag
- Ask whether the author searched for cases where shadow learning was present but skill wasn't acquired
- Ask about cases where skill was acquired WITHOUT shadow learning
- Request that the author report the full distribution of evidence (how many cases supported vs. challenged)
- Suggest that engaging with complications would strengthen rather than weaken the paper
- Example comment: "The paper presents only confirming evidence, which raises concerns about cherry-picking. Did you find any cases where shadow learning failed to produce skill, or where trainees succeeded without shadow learning? Please report the full distribution across your sample and discuss how you reconcile any disconfirming cases with your mechanism."
