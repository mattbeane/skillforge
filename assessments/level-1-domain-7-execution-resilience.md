## Section C: Execution Resilience (5 questions)

These questions test your ability to recover when things go wrong—a critical but often untaught research skill.

---

### Question 1

You're 3 months into analyzing interview data when you realize your initial coding scheme was based on a flawed assumption. Half your codes don't map to any theoretical construct. What should you do FIRST?

- a) Start over with completely new codes
- b) Push forward with existing codes and address problems in limitations
- c) Assess which codes are still valid and document what specifically failed before deciding on next steps
- d) Abandon the qualitative portion and focus on quantitative

**Correct**: c
**Why**: Before taking action, understand the scope of the problem. Some codes may be salvageable; some may not. "Start over" or "abandon" are premature; "push forward ignoring problems" creates downstream issues.

### Question 2

Your framing strategy isn't working. After three iterations, you still can't find a compelling theoretical contribution. What does this usually signal?

- a) You need to read more literature
- b) The finding itself may not support a strong contribution—or you're pursuing the wrong finding
- c) You need a co-author with better framing skills
- d) Try a different journal with lower standards

**Correct**: b
**Why**: Framing struggles often reveal that the empirical foundation is weak. Before iterating on framing endlessly, ask: Is this finding actually surprising? Strong? Robust? Sometimes you need to go back to the data.

---

### Question 3

A collaborator pushes back hard on your framing. They think you're overclaiming based on the evidence. What's the appropriate response?

- a) Defend your framing—you know the data better than they do
- b) Immediately adopt their critique and rewrite
- c) Ask them to articulate specifically which claims exceed the evidence, and evaluate each
- d) Find a more supportive collaborator

**Correct**: c
**Why**: Pushback deserves engagement, not capitulation or defense. Specificity helps: Which claims? What evidence would be needed? This turns vague disagreement into actionable revision.

---

### Question 4

You discover that a key pattern in your quantitative analysis disappears when you add an obvious control variable. What does this mean for your project?

- a) The project is dead—the finding isn't real
- b) Find a different specification where the pattern holds
- c) The finding may still be interesting as a "killed finding"—document why and assess if other patterns remain
- d) Don't report this and hope reviewers don't catch it

**Correct**: c
**Why**: Killed findings are valuable. Understanding WHY the pattern disappeared may itself be interesting. And you likely have other patterns. This isn't the end—it's information.

---

### Question 5

You're stuck. You've been working on the same framing problem for two weeks with no progress. What's the best approach?

- a) Keep pushing until you break through
- b) Set the problem aside temporarily and work on a different section or project, then return with fresh eyes
- c) Declare the paper done and submit
- d) Wait for inspiration

**Correct**: b
**Why**: Creative work often benefits from incubation. Pushing harder on a stuck problem rarely helps. Set it aside, do other productive work, and return. This isn't procrastination—it's strategic.

### Question 6 (Short Answer)

You've written a complete draft of your paper. Before submission, a colleague points you to a paper published last month that makes a very similar argument to yours.

What are your options, and how do you decide which to pursue?

**Model answer should include**:

**Options**:
1. **Differentiate**: Read the new paper carefully. Identify how your work differs (different context, different mechanism, different boundary conditions). Position your paper as extending or complementing theirs.

2. **Pivot**: If the overlap is substantial, shift your framing to address what they DIDN'T address. Your empirical work may still be valuable for a different contribution.

3. **Scoop acknowledgment**: In some cases, you cite the new paper, acknowledge they made a similar argument, and position your contribution as independent replication/extension.

4. **Abandon**: If the overlap is near-total and your evidence isn't stronger, this may not be worth submitting.

**Decision criteria**:
- How substantial is the overlap? (Exact same claim vs. related claim)
- Does your evidence add anything? (Different context, stronger data, different mechanism)
- What's your timeline? (Can you revise quickly, or will more papers appear?)
- What's your relationship with the authors? (Cite and complement vs. position against)

### Question 7 (Short Answer)

Your advisor tells you a finding you've spent 6 months developing "isn't a paper." How should you respond, and what might this mean?

**Model answer should include**:

**Possible meanings**:
1. **The finding is real but not surprising enough**: Even robust patterns may be well-established or obvious. Check: Does this violate any theoretical prediction?

2. **The finding is interesting but the framing is wrong**: The finding may be a paper, just not framed this way. Ask: "What framing would make this a paper?"

3. **The evidence is too thin**: You have a potential contribution but not enough data to support it convincingly. Ask: "What evidence would make this convincing?"

4. **The advisor is wrong**: Rare, but possible. Ask: "Who else could evaluate this?" Get a second opinion before abandoning.

**Appropriate response**:
1. Ask for specifics: "What's missing that would make it a paper?"
2. Don't defend immediately—listen first
3. Check: Is this about the finding, the framing, or the evidence?
4. Get second opinions if needed
5. Be willing to abandon if multiple experts agree

**What NOT to do**:
- Immediately abandon 6 months of work
- Ignore the feedback and submit anyway
- Take it personally

## Why Resilience Matters

Research is full of setbacks:
- Patterns don't survive
- Framings don't work
- Collaborators disagree
- Getting scooped
- Advisors reject ideas

The difference between successful researchers and struggling ones isn't avoiding these problems—it's recovering from them effectively.
