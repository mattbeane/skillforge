## New Part: Contribution Type Analysis (Added 20 points)

After identifying your top 3 patterns, you must also diagnose what TYPE of contribution each pattern could support.

### Background: Not All Contributions Are "Theory Violation"

Papers can contribute in different ways:

| Type | What It Is | Best For |
|------|------------|----------|
| **Theory Violation** | Shows established theory is wrong under conditions | Surprising patterns that contradict predictions |
| **Theory Elaboration** | Adds precision without contradiction | Patterns that refine existing understanding |
| **Phenomenon Description** | The phenomenon itself is the contribution | Novel patterns no one has documented |
| **Methodological** | New way of studying something | Patterns revealed by novel measurement |
| **Practical Insight** | Actionable knowledge for practitioners | Patterns with clear implications for action |

### Task: For EACH of Your Top 3 Patterns

Answer:

**1. What type of contribution does this pattern best support?** (Choose one from above)

**2. Justify your choice:**
- If Theory Violation: What specific theory does it contradict? What would that theory have predicted?
- If Theory Elaboration: What theory does it refine? What precision does it add?
- If Phenomenon Description: Why is this phenomenon itself novel and worth documenting?
- If Methodological: What does your measurement approach reveal that prior approaches missed?
- If Practical Insight: What specific action should practitioners take based on this pattern?

**3. Could this pattern support a DIFFERENT contribution type?** If so, which one and what would be different about the framing?

### Example

**Pattern**: Experienced workers have higher performance on newer technology even though they got less training time on it.

**Contribution Type Diagnosis**:

1. **Type**: Theory Violation
2. **Justification**: Learning curve theory predicts performance improves with cumulative experience on a specific system. This pattern contradicts that—experience on OLD systems transfers to new ones, possibly better than new-system training.
3. **Alternative**: Could be Theory Elaboration if framed as "specifying when learning curves transfer vs. don't" rather than "learning curve theory is wrong."

## Revised Rubric (100 points total)

| Criterion | Points | What We're Looking For |
|-----------|--------|------------------------|
| Found patterns | 25 | Did you identify patterns the expert found? |
| Avoided false positives | 15 | Did you avoid pursuing noise? |
| Reasoning quality | 20 | Is robustness thinking sound? |
| Completeness | 20 | Killed findings documented? Heterogeneity explored? |
| **Contribution diagnosis** | **20** | **Correctly identified contribution types? Justified choices?** |

## Evaluation Criteria for Contribution Diagnosis

**Full credit (18-20 points)**:
- Correctly identifies contribution type for all 3 patterns
- Justifications reference specific theories or literatures
- Recognizes when patterns could support multiple types
- Shows understanding that type choice affects framing strategy

**Partial credit (10-17 points)**:
- Mostly correct type identification
- Justifications are generic rather than specific
- Limited consideration of alternatives

**Minimal credit (1-9 points)**:
- Incorrect type identification
- Justifications don't connect to actual theories
- No consideration of alternatives

**Zero credit**:
- Section not attempted
- All patterns labeled "theory violation" with no justification
