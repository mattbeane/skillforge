# Domain 4: Theoretical Framing
## Level 3 Supplement - Reviewer Anticipation

**This supplements the Level 3 authentic performance task**

## New Part: Anticipate the Reviews (Added 25 points)

Before submitting your framed paper, you must demonstrate you can anticipate how reviewers will respond.

### Background: The Reviewer's Eye

Reviewers read papers looking for:
- Reasons to reject (fatal flaws)
- Concerns that require major revision
- Minor issues to fix
- What the paper does well

The best authors think like reviewers BEFORE submitting. They preemptively address concerns in the manuscript or acknowledge them in limitations.

## Task: For Your Draft Paper

After completing your framing, add a section called "Anticipated Reviews."

### Part A: Simulate Reviewer 1 (Hostile Expert)

This reviewer looks for reasons to reject.

Write a 200-300 word review from this perspective:
1. **Main concern**: What is the most likely fatal flaw they'll identify?
2. **Alternative explanation**: What competing interpretation will they raise?
3. **Literature gap**: What citation will they say is missing?
4. **Methodological attack**: What weakness in your evidence will they exploit?

### Part B: Simulate Reviewer 2 (Supportive Rigorist)

This reviewer wants to accept but has standards.

Write a 200-300 word review from this perspective:
1. **Conditional acceptance**: "This paper could be published if..."
2. **Framing improvement**: How would they suggest sharpening your contribution?
3. **Evidence request**: What additional analysis would strengthen the paper?

### Part C: Simulate Reviewer 3 (Confused Reader)

This reviewer represents the average reader who didn't fully follow.

Write a 100-200 word review from this perspective:
1. **Where they got lost**: Which section or transition was confusing?
2. **What they misunderstood**: What did they think your contribution was? (If different from your intent, that's a clarity problem)
3. **Definition needed**: What term or concept needed more explanation?

### Part D: Your Defense Plan

For each major concern raised by your simulated reviewers:

| Concern | How to Address | In Manuscript or Response Letter? |
|---------|----------------|-----------------------------------|
| [R1's main concern] | [Your response] | [Where to address it] |
| [R1's alternative explanation] | ... | ... |
| [R2's framing improvement] | ... | ... |
| [R3's confusion point] | ... | ... |

### Part E: Revise Based on Anticipation

Make at least 3 specific changes to your manuscript based on what you learned from simulating reviews:

1. **Change 1**: [What you changed and why]
2. **Change 2**: [What you changed and why]
3. **Change 3**: [What you changed and why]

## Evaluation Criteria

**Full credit (22-25 points)**:
- Simulated reviews are realistic—they sound like actual reviewers
- Identified concerns that an expert in the field would likely raise
- Defense plan is substantive, not dismissive
- Revisions genuinely strengthen the paper

**Partial credit (12-21 points)**:
- Simulated reviews are generic or too weak
- Missed obvious concerns that reviewers would raise
- Defense plan is superficial
- Revisions are cosmetic rather than substantive

**Minimal credit (1-11 points)**:
- Simulated reviews are implausible
- Self-congratulatory rather than critical
- No real engagement with potential weaknesses

**Zero credit**:
- Section not attempted
- "I don't think reviewers will have concerns"

## Why This Matters

PhD students often submit papers and are surprised by reviewer feedback. "Why didn't they understand my contribution?" "How could they think X when I clearly said Y?"

The answer: You didn't anticipate their reading. Papers exist in a conversation with skeptical readers. If you can't simulate what they'll say, you can't preempt it.

**The skill being tested**: Can you see your own work through a critical expert's eyes?

## Tips

1. **Be harsh in Reviewer 1**. Really try to find reasons to reject. The hostile reviewer exists at every journal.

2. **Make Reviewer 2 ask for something hard**. They should want something that would genuinely strengthen the paper, not just a typo fix.

3. **Reviewer 3 reveals clarity problems**. If you can't imagine how someone would get confused, you haven't thought hard enough about your exposition.

4. **Defense ≠ dismissal**. "The reviewer is wrong" is rarely a good defense. "Here's how we address their concern" is better.

5. **Revise for real**. If simulating reviews doesn't change your paper, you didn't take the exercise seriously.
