# Skill-Forge Badge Design Specifications

## Design Philosophy

These badges are **status symbols for knowledge workers**. They need to feel like something you'd proudly display on a LinkedIn profile, pin to a conference poster, or screenshot to your advisor. Think: GitHub contribution graphs, Strava achievements, Duolingo streaks—but for serious academics.

**Core tension to nail:** Intellectual gravitas + visual delight. These can't look like kiddie stickers, but they also can't look like boring certificates. They should feel *earned* and *rare*.

---

## Visual Language

### Overall Aesthetic
- **Style:** Modern heraldic meets tech badge. Think military insignia reimagined by Apple's design team.
- **Shape:** Shield/crest base with distinctive top elements per badge type
- **Dimensionality:** Subtle 3D with soft gradients—not flat, not skeuomorphic. The "neumorphism lite" that feels premium.
- **Finish:** Metallic sheen on key elements. Gold/silver/bronze hierarchy visible at a glance.

### Color Palette

**Domain Badges (by level):**
- Foundation: Bronze/copper tones (#B87333, #CD7F32) with warm cream accents
- Practice: Silver/steel tones (#C0C0C0, #A8A9AD) with cool white accents
- Mastery: Gold tones (#FFD700, #DAA520) with deep navy accents (#1a1a2e)

**Path Badges:**
- Rich jewel tones that feel prestigious
- Theory Builder: Deep sapphire (#0F52BA)
- Evidence Analyst: Emerald (#046307)
- Integrity Guardian: Ruby (#9B111E)
- Full Researcher: Royal purple (#7851A9)

**Capstone Badge:**
- Black and gold. Period. (#000000, #FFD700)
- This is the PhD of badges. It should look like something you'd frame.

## Domain Badges (21 total)

### Structure
Each domain badge has a consistent base shape with:
1. **Central icon** representing the skill
2. **Level indicator** (ring/border treatment)
3. **Domain number** subtly integrated
4. **Texture/pattern** unique to each domain

### Domain 1: Pattern Recognition & Data Sense

**Concept:** The all-seeing eye that finds signal in noise.

**Visual elements:**
- Central icon: Stylized eye with data points/constellation pattern in the iris
- Radiating lines suggesting pattern detection
- Subtle grid/matrix texture in background
- The eye should feel analytical, not mystical—more "machine learning" than "illuminati"

**Tagline for designer:** "Sherlock Holmes meets data science"

---

### Domain 2: Theoretical Positioning

**Concept:** The compass that finds your place in intellectual space.

**Visual elements:**
- Central icon: Compass rose with an academic twist—points could be labeled with subtle theory-related symbols

## Capstone Badge: AI Supervisor 🤖

**THE badge. This is what everyone is working toward.**

### Concept
You are now qualified to supervise AI in research. You can catch what it misses. You are the human in the loop that makes AI-assisted research trustworthy.

**Shape:** Circular medallion with octagonal inner frame (8 sides = 7 domains + capstone)

**Central icon:**
- Stylized human figure and AI/robot figure in partnership

- Eye/oversight element prominent

**Color:**

- This should look like something Tony Stark would wear

**Border:**

## What These Badges Must Make People Feel

1. **"I want that."** Before they've earned it.
2. **"I earned that."** Pride, not just completion.
3. **"Let me show you this."** Shareability built in.
4. **"They have THAT one?!"** Jealousy for the rare ones.
5. **"This means something."** Not participation trophies.

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- ❌ Clip art aesthetic
- ❌ Flat/boring corporate
- ❌ Childish/gamification-cheesy
- ❌ So abstract nobody knows what it means
- ❌ Text-dependent (should read at glance without words)
- ❌ Generic "achievement unlocked" energy
- ❌ Busy/cluttered—these need to read at 64px

## Final Note to Designer

These badges represent real expertise that takes months to develop. PhD students will spend 50-100 hours earning the full set. The badges need to honor that investment.

Think of how a surgeon displays their board certification, or how a pilot displays their wings. It's not flashy, but it MEANS something. That's the energy.

Make people want to work for these.
